\subsubsection{from adjectives}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Diphthongization of the short vowels \bt{E}, \bt{i} and \bt{y} to \bt{e\tsa{I}}, \bt{o} and \bt{u} to \bt{o\dpu}, and the fronting of \bt{a} to \bt{E}, or the lowering of the long high vowels \bt{i:} to \bt{E} and \bt{u:} and \bt{y:} to \bt{o}. Diphthongs, on the other hand are simplified, with fronting diphthongs becoming \bt{E:} and backing diphthongs becoming \bt{o:}. This also involves the affricatization of the coda consonant or the sporadic addition of a \bt{k} or \bt{\ttb{ts}}. The resultant verb has the general meaning of `to become \mk{adj},' although most have taken more idiomatic meanings. This process is no longer productive and thus cannot be used to derived new verbs.
