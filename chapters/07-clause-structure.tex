\chapter{Clause structure}

\section{Introduction}

The constituent word order of Iridian sentences is SOV, but the agglutinative nature of the language and the presence of case-marking on nouns makes word order typically flexible, with the only universal rule being that the main verb should appear at the end of a sentence.

\section{Topic-predicate constructions}\index{topic}\index{predicate}\label{sec:topic-pred}
The Iridian sentence can be divided primarily into a topic part and a predicate
or comment part. The topic is what the sentence is about, while the predicate or comment represents the information presented in the sentence about the topic. While both the topic and the predicate are pragmatic constructs, the topic-predicate construction is important as it determines how the rest of the sentence is structured.

  \begin{forest}
    [S,
      [{\sc top}] [{\sc pred}]]
  \end{forest}
  \caption{Nuclear structure of sentences}

\end{figure}

The topic of the sentence does not necessarily coincide with the subject of the sentence. This is true as well in English, as we see in example (\ref{ex:engtop}); although where English allows the topic to appear anywhere in the sentence, as long as the subject is placed first, Iridian, typical of topic-prominent languages. requires the topic to always be introduced first, leaving the rest of the information afterwards.


\pex\label{ex:engtop}
\a Martha saw John.
\a A dog bit \emph{Martha}.
\a It is raining \emph{today},
\xe


\pex

\a
\begingl
\gla \relax[Janek]\tss{\mk{Top}} [mlaza boulešik.]\tss{\mk{Pred}}//
\glft \trsl{As for Janek, he killed his brother}.//
\endgl

\a
\begingl
\gla \relax[Tereza]\tss{\mk{Top}} [jecám nalečnik.]\tss{\mk{Pred}}//
\glft \trsl{As for Tereza, she was bitten by a dog}//
\endgl

\a
\begingl
\gla \relax[Shléd]\tss{\mk{Top}} [zniepšalí.]\tss{\mk{Pred}}//
\glft \trsl{As for today, it is raining.}//
\endgl

\xe


More importantly, the topic of the sentence determines how the main verb, and thus all the other constituents of the sentence, are marked.

\pex
\a
\begingl
\gla Tereza jec{ám} naleč{n}ik.//
\glft \trsl{As for Tereza, she was bitten by a dog}//
\endgl

\a
\begingl
\gla Jec Terez{e} nalč{eš}ik.//
\glft \trsl{As for the dog, it bit Tereza.}//
\endgl

\xe

As \textcite[9]{kiss2004} notes:

\begin{quote}
  We tend to describe eventsfrom a human perspective, as statements about theirhuman participants – and subjects are more often {\sc[+human]} than objects are. Inthe case of verbs with a {\sc[–human]} subject and a {\sc[+human]} accusative or obliquecomplement,  the  most  common  permutation  is  that  in  which  the  accusative  oroblique complement occupies the topic position\,[.] When the possessor is theonly human involved in an action or state, the possessor is usually topicalized[.]
\end{quote}

\section{The noun phrase}

Iridian is a strongly head-final language.

\section{Topicless sentences}\label{sec:topicless}\index{topicless sentence}

\section{Definiteness}\index{definiteness}\label{sec:definiteness}

Iridian lacks a specific class of articles\index{articles} such as English
\trsl{a} or \trsl{the} to mark the opposition between definite and indefinite
nouns. For example, the word \ird{jec} can mean both \trsl{a dog} or \trsl{the
dog} depending on the context (or in some environments the same word can be
interpreted as \trsl{dogs,} \trsl{some dogs} or \trsl{the dogs}).

A common way to specificy the definiteness of a noun is to promote it to the
topic position in the sentence. As discussed in \S\,\ref{sec:topic-pred}, the
topic of a sentence must be specific and referential, and therefore it is often,
but not always, definite. Consider for example the two sentences below.

\begin{multicols}{2}
  \pex
  \a
  \begingl
  \gla Pitár pižmo.//
  \glb Pitár farmer//
  \glft \trsl{Pitar is {a} farmer.}//
  \endgl
  \a
  \begingl
  \gla Pižmo Pitár.//
  \glb farmer Pitár//
  \glft \trsl{Pitár is {the} farmer.}//
  \endgl
  \xe
\end{multicols}

This can be extended to non-copular constructions.

\begin{multicols}{2}
  \pex
  \a
  \begingl
  \gla Vliče štanžice.//
  \glb milk-\Gen{} drink-\Av{}-\Pf{}-\Quot{}//
  \glft \trsl{(I) drank some milk.}//
  \endgl
  \a
  \begingl
  \gla Vliko štanimce.//
  \glb milk drink-\Pv{}-\Pf{}-\Quot{}//
  \glft \trsl{(I) drank the milk.}//
  \endgl
  \xe
\end{multicols}

If the topic is quantified\index{quantifier} by a numeral\index{numeral}, indefiniteness can be expressed by nominalizing\index{nominalization} the main verb and promoting it to topic.

\pex
\a
\begingl
\gla Jaro okrád za propozica niebidček.//
\glb five district for proposal-\Acc{} vote:against-\Av{}-\Pf{}//
\glft \trsl{The five districts voted against the proposal.}//
\endgl
\a
\begingl
\gla Za propozica niebidečkou jaro okrád.//
\glb for proposal-\Acc{} vote:against-\Av{}-\Pf{}-\Nz{} five district//
\glft \trsl{Five districts voted against the proposal.}//
\endgl
\a
\begingl
\gla Za propozica niebidečkou ko okrád jaro.//
\glb for proposal-\Acc{} vote:against-\mk{av-pf-nz} \mk{rz} district five//
\glft \trsl{Five is the number of districts that voted against the proposal.}//
\endgl
\xe

The number one (\ird{oní})

\pex
\a
\begingl
\gla Tóm onaževí.//
\glb book be:lost-\mk{cont}//
\glft \trsl{The book is missing.}//
\endgl
\a
\begingl
\gla Oní tóm onaževí.//
\glb one book be:lost-\mk{cont}//
\glft \trsl{One of the books is missing.}//
\endgl
\a
\begingl
\gla Onaživou pní tóm.//
\glb one book be:lost-\mk{cont}//
\glft \trsl{One of the books is missing.}//
\endgl
\a
\begingl
\gla Onaživou pní tóm.//
\glb one book be:lost-\mk{cont}//
\glft \trsl{One of the books is missing.}//
\endgl
\xe


Note that this rule is not universal and the topic of a sentence does not necessarily have to be definite, especially where the sentence is merely expressing a fact or a general truth:

\pex
\begingl
\gla Jec hvárem.//
\glb dog animal//
\glft \trsl{Dogs are animals.}//
\endgl
\xe



\pex
\begingl
\gla To >>jec<< hvárem že: to robot//
\glb \Dem{} dog animal \mk{ncop} \Dem{} robot//
\glft \trsl{The ``dog'' is not a real animal but a robot.}//
\endgl
\xe




\section{Coordination} \index{coordination}

Iridian has three groups of coordinating conjunctions: the additive \irdp{a}{and} and \irdp{še}{with};
the contrastive \ird{má} and \ird{ozná} (both translated to \printlang{en}\index{English} as \trsl{but}); and the disjunctive/correlative \ird{je}, \ird{le} and \ird{ni}.

\ird{A} corresponds to the English \trsl{and.} When coordinating simple noun pairs, however, \irdp{še} is more often used though. The derived construction \ird{a še} is also common and has a similar meaning to the English \trsl{and also}.

\pex
\begingl
    \gla Mámka {še} pápku na Prahe spaníček.//
    \glb mother-\Dim{} \Com{} father-\Dim{}-\Ins{} \Loc{} Prague-\Acc{} vacation-\Av{}-\Pf{}//
    \glft \trsl{Mom and Dad went to Prague for vacation.}//
\endgl
\xe
\pex
\begingl
    \gla Janek {a} {še} Marku kurs hlupinžice.//
    \glb Janek and \Com{} Marek-\Ins{} class fail-\Av{}-\Pf{}-\Quot{}//
    \glft \trsl{Janek as well as Marek failed the class.}//
\endgl
\xe

In constructions with \ird{še} where one of the nouns coordinated is a pronoun or a deictic\index{deictic}, the pronoun or deictic is presented first followed by the other noun in the instrumental case\index{isnstrumental case}.

\pex
\begingl
    \gla Dá {še} Ivanu sohladoušce.//
    \glb \mk{1s.str} \Com{} Ivan-\Ins{} classmate//
    \glft \trsl{Ivan and I are classmates.}//
\endgl
\xe

In a few cases, \ird{a} is used instead of \ird{še} where the latter can be interpreted as having an attributive meaning. Where the noun is marked, however, only \ird{a} can be used.

\begin{multicols}{2}
\pex\a
\begingl
    \gla trava {še} lépu//
    \glb bread \Com{} cheese-\Ins{}//
    \glft \trsl{bread with cheese} i.e., \trsl{cheese sandwich}//
\endgl
\a
\begingl
    \gla trava {a} lép//
    \glb bread and cheese//
    \glft \trsl{bread and cheese}//
\endgl
\xe\end{multicols}

\pex
\begingl
    \gla To kurs-te Jankám {a} Markám hlupienince.//
    \glb this class-\Foc{} Janek-\Agt{} and Marek-\Agt{} class fail-\Pv{}-\Pf{}-\Quot{}//
    \glft \trsl{It was this class that Marek and Janek failed.}//
\endgl
\xe


The bisyndetic coordination (\cite{velupillai2012}) \ird{a} Y \ird{a} Y is also with similar emphatic meaning as \ird{a še}.

\pex
\begingl
    \gla {a} plocem {a} ploceš.//
    \glb and family-\First{}\Sg{} and family-\mk{2s}//
    \glft \trsl{both my family and yours}//
\endgl
\xe

\pex
\begingl
    \gla {a} hastu {a} še zmenu zov\v{e}c hloubižách.//
    \glb and suffering-\mk{} and \Com{} happiness-\Ins{} remain-\Cv{} love-\mk{av-ctpv}//
    \glft \trsl{Til death do us part.} \emph{Lit.,} \trsl{I will love you through both suffering and joy.}//
\endgl
\xe

With multiple nouns or noun phrases, especially in serial lists, the coordinating conjunction is often simply dropped.

\pex
\begingl
    \gla Ivan, Jarek, Elena na meza.//
    \glb Ivan Jarek Elena \Loc{} room-\Acc{}//
    \glft \trsl{Ivan, Jarek, and Elena are in the room.}//
\endgl
\xe

\pex
\begingl
    \gla Morkve, hlepost, ruk, molec hladniževí.//
    \glb carrot asparagus broccoli cabbage to:displease-\Av{}-\Cont{}//
    \glft \trsl{I don't like carrots, asparagus, broccoli or cabbage.}//
\endgl
\xe

\ird{A} or \ird{še} however is required when two adjectives are used to modify a noun, with \ird{še} used when the two adjectives describe the same noun and \ird{a} (or often \ird{a še}) when describing two distinct objects.\footnote{When used this way, the noun preceding \ird{še} or \ird{a še} is not declined in the instrumental case.}

\pex
\a
\begingl
    \gla Sodoví {še} ludí kobera tahatnik.//
    \glb black with white shirt bring-\Pv{}-\Pf{}//
    \glft \trsl{I brought the black-and-white shirt.}//
\endgl
\a
\begingl
    \gla Sodoví {a} {(še)} ludí kobera tahatnik.//
    \glb black and with white shirt bring-\Pv{}-\Pf{}//
    \glft \trsl{I brought the black shirt as well as the white one.}//
\endgl
\xe

Other common uses of \ird{a} and \ird{\v{s}e} are described in detail in section \S\,\ref{sec:conn-conj}

The particle \irdp{neb\'i}{also} may take a conjunctive meaning when attached to multiple elements in a sentence, similar to \irdp{a\ldots{} a\ldots}{both\ldots{} and\ldots} but more emphatic.

\pex
\begingl
    \gla Luk\'a\v{s} neb\'i Marek neb\'i na\v{z}//
    \glb Luk\'a\v{s} also Marek also friend//
    \glft \trsl{Luka\v{s} and Marek are also my friends.}//
\endgl
\xe

\ird{Má} and \ird{ozná} are used to express contrast, like the English \trsl{but}. \ird{Ozná} however is more restrictive, and can only be used if the first clause is in the negative and the second clause directly contradicts (or provides an alternative to) the first. The clause introduced by \ird{ozná} must directly correspond to the element in the first clause being negated. Where the initial element is inflected, such inflection must also be reflected on the alternative presented in the \ird{ozná} clause.\footnote{The syntax of the main clause does not necessarily correspond to how the sentence would have otherwise been constructed in isolation. For instance, the neutral syntax for example (\getref{ozna}) without the \ird{ozná} would be: \ird{Bi\k{e}c záčesčeví.}}

\pex
\begingl
\gla Stožek má na duma niho čast.//
\glb go-\Av{}-\Pf{} but \Loc{} house-\Acc{} \mk{nexst} person//
\glft \trsl{I went but no one was home.}//
\endgl
\xe


\pex[tag=ozna]
\begingl
\gla Zám bi\k{e}c česčeví ozná jec.//
\glb \Neg{} cat to:please-\Av{}-\Cont{} but dog//
\glft \trsl{(I) don't like cats but I do like dogs.}//
\endgl
\xe

\ird{Ozná} does not allow a negative\index{negation} argument. If the main clause is positive and the secondary clause is negative, \ird{má} is used instead.

\pex
\begingl
\gla To jako odpizdnounilá to hrebe cešceví, má zám ján.//
\glb \Dem{}.\Prox{} tree to:grow-\Loc{}-\Subj{}.\Ipf{} \Rz{} mushroom-\Acc{} to:please-\Av{}-\Cont{} but \Neg{} \Dem{}.\Med{}//
\glft \trsl{Mushrooms love to grow under this tree, but not under that one.}//
\endgl
\xe

\ird{Má} or its variant \ird{a má} (literally \trsl{and but}) is also used to introduce exclamatory sentences. This usage is purely idiomatic and does not require for there to be an actual contrastive meaning in the sentences.

\pex
\begingl
\gla A má duma nahte ašteví!//
\glb and but house too:much be:pretty-\Cont{}//
\glft \trsl{Your house is very beautiful!}//
\endgl
\xe

Finally, the disjunctive conjunctions\index{disjunctive conjunction} \ird{je}, \ird{li}, and \ird{ni} are used to join phrases or sentences that are seen as alternatives to each other. \irdp{Je}{or} may be used to separate the alternatives proposed, or reduplicated, preceding each of the components of the sentence (i.e., \irdp{je X je Y}{either X or Y}); this latter use often means that the options being presented are the only ones available. \ird{Ni}\footnote{\ird{Ni} is an Indo-European, possibly Slavic, borrowing.\index{linguistic borrowing}} is the inverse of \ird{je} and must always be used in pairs (\irdp{ni X ni Y}{neither X nor Y}) as when used alone it functions as an adverb (similar to English \trsl{not even} or \trsl{at all}). An obvious exception, however, would be in a conversation, when a speaker would provide a negative alternative response to an already negative statement (see example (\getfullref{ni.resp}) below).

\pex
\begingl
\gla Ni ircevní ni ruščevní malnovím zahviržéteví.//
\glb nor Iridian-\Att{} nor Russian-\Att{} tongue-\Ins{} speak-\Av{}-\Pot{}-\Cont{}//
\glft \trsl{I can't speak neither Iridian nor Russian.}//
\endgl
\xe

\pex\a\begingl
\gla Dá ircevní malnovím ni zazahviržéteví.//
\glb \First{}\Sg{}\Str{} Iridian-\Att{} tongue-\Ins{} not:even speak-\Av{}-\Pot{}-\Cont{}//
\glft \trsl{I can't speak any Iridian at all.}//
\endgl
\a\begingl
\gla Ni ircevní ni ruščevní malnovím zahviržéteví.//
\glb nor Iridian-\Att{} nor Russian-\Att{} tongue-\Ins{} speak-\Av{}-\Pot{}-\Cont{}//
\glft \trsl{I can't speak neither Iridian nor Russian.}//
\endgl
\a\vtop{\halign{%

\ird{---\,Ni dá.} & \trsl{Neither do I.}\cr
}}\deftagex{ni}\deftaglabel{resp}
\xe

\ird{Le} (another possible Slavic\index{Slavic} borrowing\index{linguistic borrowing}, adopted from Common Slavic \emph{li} or \emph{ili}) has a more emphatic and contrastive meaning than \ird{je}. It is used when the speaker thinks that the option being presented is counterfactual or doubtful. Unlike \ird{je} or \ird{ni}, \ird{le} is added to the end of the word or phrase. \ird{Le} is most often used in parenthetical statements or in responses; it cannot be used by itself when both alternatives are present and must be introduced instead by either \ird{je} or \ird{a}.

\pex\a\begingl
\gla Marek-le ruščevní malnovím zahviržéteví.//
\glb Marek=or Russian-\Att{} tongue-\Ins{} speak-\Av{}-\Pot{}-\Cont{}//
\glft \trsl{Or maybe Marek can speak Iridian.}//

\glft \trsl{Karel\,---\,or maybe even Tereza\,---\,can come with you to Rome.}//
\endgl\xe

\section{Apposition}\index{apposition}\label{sec:apposition}

Appositive constructions in Iridian involve the juxtaposition of two or more noun phrases that have a single referent. An apposition can be non-restrictive if the appositive can be removed freely without changing the meaning of a sentence, or restrictive otherwise.

Formally both non-restrictive and restrictive appositives are treated as modifier phrases but only the latter is grammaticalized. The restrictive appositive must always precede the noun phrase it modifies, linked together by the particle \ird{ko}. Non-restrictive appositives on the other hand are simply juxtaposed together, although a comma is often inserted around the appositive if it consists of more than one word.

\pex\a
\begingl\deftagex{appos}\deftaglabel{1}
    \gla \'Oto mlazka na Mnihe znohouščeví.//
    \glb  \'Oto brother-\Dim{} \Loc{} Munich-\Acc{} study-\Av{}-\Cont{}//
    \glft \trsl{My brother Otto is studying in Munich.}//
\endgl
\a\begingl\deftagex{appos}\deftaglabel{res}
    \gla \'Oto {ko} mlazka na Mnihe znohouščeví.//
    \glb  \'Oto \Lnk{} brother-\Dim{} \Loc{} Munich-\Acc{} study-\Av{}-\Cont{}//
    \glft \trsl{My brother Otto is studying in Munich.}//
\endgl
\xe

Examples(\getfullref{appos.1}) and (\getfullref{appos.res}) shows two different translations of the English phrase \trsl{My brother \'Oto is studying in Munich.} Example (\getfullref{appos.1}) is non-restrictive and can be interpreted as \trsl{I have a brother namsed \'Oto who is studying in Munich} while (\getfullref{appos.res}) being restrictive can be translated more on the lines of \trsl{Among my brothers, it is \'Oto who is studying in Munich.} The restrictive appositive implies specificity and by extension the existence of a group where this specificity holds true; in (\getfullref{appos.res}) this is taken to mean that a set of brothers exists and \'Oto is a member of this set.


\section{Syntax of event and participant nominals}\index{nominalisation!event nominal}\label{sec:nomz-syntax}

As we have established in \S~\ref{nom-morph}, Iridian has three forms of nominalisation\index{nominalisation}: (1)~the mainly non-productive usage of the nominalising \ird{-ou} with the verbal stem to form resultant nominals; (2)~the use of \ird{-ou} in conjunction with the gerund-forming prefix\index{gerund} \ird{po(d)-} to form a verbal noun (which we call an event nominal or gerund) and which may either include the internal arguments of the parent verb or not; and (3)~the formation of a participant nominal (cf.~\cite{okuna}) which nominalises not the event described by the verb but its participants.

Since gerunds\index{gerund} represent the nominalisation of the event\index{event nominal} described by the verb, they are therefore inherently abstract and active in meaning. Since the nominalised forms are abstract, it follows that they are also tenseless and aspectless. Iridian gerunds, however, may be optionally marked for their lexical aspect or \foreign{aktionsart}\index{aktionsart@\emph{aktionsart}}\index{lexical aspect|see{\emph{aktionsart}}} using the continuous aspect suffix \ird{-eví} (which subsequently becomes \ird{-ív-} through sound change). It is important to note though that although a marker for grammatical aspect\index{aspect} is used, what is being marked is lexical and not grammatical aspect; specifically, the addition of \ird{-ív-} only signifies that the action is iterative in nature and thus the gerund itself remains tenseless\index{tense} and aspectless.

\begin{multicols}{2}
\pex
    \a \ird{nidá}\,$\rightarrow$\,\ird{nidou}\\
        \trsl{(my) standing up}
    \a \ird{nidá}\,$\rightarrow$\,\ird{ponidívou}\\
        \trsl{(my) standing up repeatedly}
\xe
\end{multicols}

In CENs, both the agent and the patient are marked in the genitive.\index{genitive}\footnote{\textcite{serekaite2020} argues that although (in the case of Lithuanian, at least) the actor and the theme from the original sentence both become marked in the genitive in the resulting complex event nominal, the superficially indentical genitives are actually two distinct cases: a higher genitive ({\sc gen.h}) assigned to agents and possessors and a lower genitive ({\sc gen.l}) assigned to grammatical objects. Although this argument is interesting and probably holds true as well in Iridian CENs, we will not make an effort to ascertain whether there is an actual difference in the two genitive cases in Iridian as this is not needed for the purpose of this grammar.} If both are present, the agent must always appear first. This construction is quite common cross-linguistically, as we see in the examples below.

\pex
\a\begingl
    \gla Mlazc\v{e} praví na Mnihe poznohouštou na zahrana nemniček.//
    \glb brother-\Dim{}-\Gen{} law-\Gen{} \Loc{} Munich-\Acc{} \Ger{}-study-\Nz{} \Loc{} beginning-\Acc{} surprise-\Av{}-\Pf{}//
    \glft \trsl{My brother's studying law (i.e., my brother's decision to study law) in Munich surprised us at first.}//
\endgl

    \gla Jono augal\k{u} sunaikinimas.//
    \glb Jonas-\Gen{} plants-\Gen{} \Pfv{}-destroy-\Caus{}-\Nz-\Nom{}.\M{}.\Sg{}//
    \glft \trsl{Jonas' destruction of plants}//\deftagex{doubgen}\deftaglabel{lithuanian}

    \glft \trsl{What happened was Harvey's cooking (of chicken).}//\deftagex{doubgen}\deftaglabel{tagalog}
\endgl
\xe

The use of the genitive\index{genitive} to mark both the actor and the theme in the original sentence is of course a recipe for ambiguity. When only one of either the actor or the theme is present in the CEN, the ambiguity is on whether the noun marked represents the one or the other, as, e.g., the phrase \ird{Janc\v{e} podohletou} which can be interpreted to mean either \trsl{the act of remembering Janek} or \trsl{Janek's act of remembering} without any further information. A second ambiguity arises when both the actor and the theme are in the sentence as it is unclear, without any context, the genitive is actually being used to mark their thematic role in the originally or is in fact a possessive. The same is true in, for example, Lithuanian\index{Lithuanian} where as \textcite{serekaite2020} points out, sentence (\getfullref{doubgen.lithuanian}) can also be alternatively translated as \trsl{[the] destruction of Jonas's plants}.

The first type of ambiguity is resolved in English\index{English} by using word order: in general, a prepositive genitive (i.e., using the clitic \foreign{'s} or the possessive form of a pronoun) is used when the noun in the genitive case in the CEN represents the actor (e.g., \trsl{John's remembering}) while a postpositive genitive is used when the noun in the genitive represents the theme (e.g., \trsl{the remembering of John}). This in turn, can be extended to the second type, e.g., \trsl{John's remembering of Margaret}. However, the obligatorily head-final nature of Iridian syntax means that such strategy is not possible. Instead, the strategy used in Iridian is more similar to the one found in Tagalog\index{Tagalog} where the theme may be marked using the oblique \foreign{sa}\footnote{This becomes \foreign{kay} before proper nouns.} instead of the genitive \foreign{ng}.\footnote{
    To call \foreign{ng} (pronounced [nɐŋ]) as a genitive marker is simplistic (even erroneous) but should be enough for the purpose of our discussion.
} Thus we can restate (\getfullref{doubgen.tagalog}) as follows:

\pex{Tagalog\index{Tagalog} (modified from \cite[22]{hsieh2019})}\\
\begingl

An immediate consequence of replacing the genitive \foreign{ng} with the oblique marker \foreign{sa/kay} is that the theme is now interpreted as definite (cf.~\cite[3,\,40]{kaufman2009}). The use of the oblique to mark the theme can be used even when only one element is present in the event nominal; in fact, when the theme is known as definite for a fact (e.g., if it is a person), the choice between the oblique and the genitive is what distinguishes the actor and the theme. Thus we have

\pex[interpartskip=0pt]
    \a Choice between \Obl{} and \Gen{} distinguishing actor from theme
    \beginsubsub\index{Tagalog}
        \b{--}{\foreign{pagtawag kay {\nf{[\Obl{}]}} Harvey}\\ \trsl{the act of calling Harvey}}
        \b{--}{\foreign{pagtawag ni {\nf{[\Gen{}]}} Harvey}\\ \trsl{Harvey's act of calling}}
    \endsubsub
    \a Resolving ambiguity by obligatory replacement of \Gen{} by \Obl{} in the theme:
    \beginsubsub
        \b{--}{\foreign{pagtawag ni {\nf{[\Gen{}]}} Harvey sa {\nf{[\Obl{}]}} kasama}\\
        \trsl{Harvey's act of calling his \mbox{colleague}}}
        \b{--}{\foreign{pagtawag ni {\nf{[\Gen{}]}} Harvey ng {\nf{[\Gen{}]}} kasama}\\
        \trsl{Harvey's act of calling a colleague}}
    \endsubsub
    \a New ambiguity introduced by changing the word order:
    \beginsubsub
        \b{--} {\foreign{pagtawag ng {\nf{[\Gen{}]}} kasama ni {\nf{[\Gen{}]}} Harvey}\\
        \trsl{Harvey's act of calling a colleague} or \trsl{The act of calling Harvey's colleague}}
    \endsubsub
    \a Ungrammatical form, with both the theme and actor marked in the oblique:
    \beginsubsub
        \b{--}{\ljudge{*}\foreign{pagtawag kay {\nf{[\Obl{}]}} Harvey sa {\nf{[\Obl{}]}} kasama,}\\
        \trsl{Harvey's act of calling a colleague}}
    \endsubsub
    \a Double genitive, with both indefinite actor and theme:
    \beginsubsub
        \b{--}{\foreign{pagtawag ng {\nf{[\Gen{}]}} tao ng {\nf{[\Gen{}]}} kasama,}\\
        \trsl{a person's act of calling a colleague} or \trsl{a colleague's act of calling of a person}}

In Iridian, the a \ird{na} clause corresponds to the Tagalog\index{Tagalog} use of the oblique to indicate a definite theme in a CEN.

\section{Subordinate clauses in general}


\section{Clause-linking strategies}
\subsection{Clause-linking with \ird{še}}

\subsection{Temporal succession and causality}

Iridian has three main conjunctions used in linking clauses to indicate causality and temporal sequency: \ird{vele}, \ird{dito}, and \ird{d\v{e}la}.\footnote{A fourth one exists, \ird{v\v{e}lne}, in fact exists, but it is essentially the same as \ird{vele}, but there is no real difference between it and vele, and one can use the one or the other without changing the meaning of the sentence. Nevertheless, one would find vele as the more common variant.} One might think that the three conjunctions would correspond neatly with the three levels in which we could interpret the causation, as we have discussed above, but that is not the case. Indeed, as in any other language, there exists a significant overlap in their usage.

\ird{Vele/v\v{e}lne} and \ird{dito} are used in a propositional level causation. They are often interchangeable but, in case of ellipsis (i.e., the omission of either parts of the causational pair), both \ird{vele/v\v{e}lne} and \ird{dito} may only appear with the protatic clause (the `cause' in the cause-effect pair), although \ird{dito} must be fronted first, appearing immediately before the verb, which movement is only optional for \ird{vele/v\v{e}lne.} Although both clause-initial and clause-final vele/velne have the same meaning, the latter would often be characterized as informal.


\pex
\a\begingl
  \gla Zabola ce zákupinenik vele byl kravnašime.//
  \glb ice:cream \Dem{}-\Acc{} \Neg{}-buy-\Pv{}-\Pf{} because child cry-\Av{}-\Prog{}//
  \glft \trsl{The child is crying because (they) did not buy him ice cream.}//
\endgl
\a\begingl
  \gla Zabola ce zákupinenik dito byl kravnašime.//
  \glb ice:cream \Dem{}-\Acc{} \Neg{}-buy-\Pv{}-\Pf{} because child cry-\Av{}-\Prog{}//
  \glft \trsl{The child is crying because (they) did not buy him ice cream.}//
\endgl
\a \ird{Zabola ce zákupinenik vele.}
\a \ljudge{*}\ird{Zabola ce zákupinenik dito.}
\a \ird{Zabola ce vele zákupinenik.} 
\a \ird{Zabola ce dito zákupinenik.}
\xe 

Another example illustrating the non-interchangeability of vele/vělne and dito is the unembeddability of vele/vělne unde semantic operators such as negation.

\pex
\a\begingl
  \gla Mamka těhto zám dito záščenžek.//
  \glb mother-\Dim{} sick \Neg{} because \Neg{}-arrive-\Av{}-\Pf{}//
\endgl
\a \ljudge{*}\ird{Mamka těhto zam vele záščenžek.}
\xe

\ird{D\v{e}la}, on the other hand, is often used in framing epistemic level causality. In addition, \ird{d\v{e}la}, unlike \ird{vele/v\v{e}lne} and \ird{dito}, govern the apodotic clause (the `effect' in the cause-effect pair) and should thus be translated more correctly as \trsl{thus/therefore}. Consequently, \ird{d\v{e}la} can appear in the same sentence with \ird{vele/v\v{e}lne}, but not with \ird{dito}; this latter usage has a greater explanatory force than the simple use of either \ird{d\v{e}la} or \ird{vele/v\v{e}lne}.

\section{Converbial constructions}\label{converbs-syntax}\index{converb}

\subsection{In general}

\subsection{Adverbial converbs}\index{converb}

A common type of compound verb construction involves the main verb preceded by the imperfective converbial form of a secondary verb. The secondary verb normally specifies the manner or the means by which the action descrubed by the main verb is performed.


\subsection{Temporal constructions}

A converbial construction is often used in temporal clauses\index{temporal clause}, with the imperfective converbial form used when the action is unfinished or continuing and the perfective otherwise. When used in a temporal clause, the converb may sometimes be separated from the main clause by the particle \ird{si}.\footnote{\ird{Si} is virtually never used in the spoken language.}

\pex
\begingl
\gla Otv\v{e}c (si) na Varšave možlašaní.//
\glb be:young-\mk{cv.ipf} when \Loc{} Warsaw-\Acc{} understand-\mk{av-ret}//
\glft \trsl{When I was young, we used to live in Warsaw.}//
\endgl
\xe

\subsection{Causal clauses}

Clauses expressing reason are usually expressed by a converbial construction. The antecedent and the main clause may be connected with \irdp{am}{because,} although this is often dropped in casual speech.

\pex
\begingl
\gla Za prove záznohouštu Martin meštnašek.//
\glb for exam-\Acc{} \Neg{}-study-\mk{cv.pf} Martin fail-\Av{}-\Pf{}//
\glft \trsl{Martin failed the exam because he didn't study.}//
\endgl

\glb cinema-\Acc{} go-\Av{}-\Sbj{}.\Ipf{} \Rz{} be:angry-\Cv{}.\Ipf{} mother-\Dim{} allow-\Av{}-\Pf{}//
\glft \trsl{Since she was still mad at us, Mum did not let us go to the movies.}//
\endgl
\xe


\subsection{Transgressive clauses}\index{converb}

Converbs in Iridian have parallel usage as the transgressive\index{transgressive} conjugations in \printlang{cs}\index{Czech} and Slovak\index{Slovak}. It is the consensus among scholars of the languages, though, that the converbial forms in Iridian and the transgressive forms in Czech and Slovak, developed independently of each other; although to what extent one influenced the other is still the subject of debate. The converbial forms in Iridian have more varied uses than the transgressives in Czech (Slovak having kept only the present transgressive form), and whereas the latter forms have largely fallen in disuse (relegated to the literary register) in both Czech and Slovak, converbial forms are still widely used in Iridian.

Although Czech grammarians use the terms `past' and `present' to distinguish between the two forms used in the language, the distinction is actually one of aspect\index{aspect}, as in Iridian. In general, the past transgressive form corresponds with the perfect converbial form, and may be used to indicate a foregoing action; the present transgressive, on the other hand, corresponds to the imperfect converb and is used to indicate a coincident/contemporaneous action.

This correspondence is not complete, however. For example, consider this sentence in Czech\index{Czech}: \foreign{Děti, {vidouce} babičku, vyběhly ven}{The children, seeing their grandmother, ran outside.} The verb in the transgressive clause is in the present tense in this case, while in Iridian, the same sentence will be translated with the perfective as follows:

\pex
\begingl
\gla \v{S}ášlika vedu byl nalad\v{e}c mnilžek.//
\glb grandmother-\mk{dim-pat} see-\mk{cv.pf} children run-\mk{cv.ipf} go:out-\Av{}-\Pf{}//
\glft \trsl{The children, having seen their grandmother, ran outside.}//
\endgl
\xe

The Czech\index{Czech} sentence above can alternatively be translated using the imperfective converbial form, but this would put a stronger emphasis on the two actions happening at the same time and so the original construction can be considered as the more idiomatic one.

\subsection{In fixed expressions}

The past converbial form is used in expressing gratitude, approbation or condolencess, or in asking for forgiveness. This usage is idiomatic and the actions do not necessarily need to have been completed. The main clause is often in the hortative mood\index{hortative mood} and separated from the converb clause with \irdp{am}{because.} Moreover, this usage, unlike most converbial constructions, allow the verb of the converb clause to have a different subject as long as such subject is marked explicitly in the agentive case. However, since the converbial form of verbs are invariable, if the subordinate clause requires further complexity when it comes to the verb in the converb clause, a dependent \ird{še} clause may be use instead of a converb.

\a Expressing gratitude:\\
\begingl
\gla Stranu am luhninká.//

\section{Quotative constructions and  evidentiality}\label{sec:reportedspeech}\index{reported speech}\index{indirect speech|see{reported speech}}\index{evidentiality}


\subsection{Quotative construction in general}

{\sc evidentiality} is a grammatical category that is concered in the explicit encoding of a source of information or knowledge (i.e. evidence) which the speaker claims to have made use of for producing the primary proposition of the utterance (\cite[1-2]{diewald2010}). Iridian is unique among languages of Central Europe (and of Europe in general) in possessing a grammaticalised evidentiality system. Even non-Indo European languages in the region such as Hungarian (cf. author) or Basque (cf. \cite{alcazar2010}) do not possess an overt evidential. Of course a speaker’s source of information may be expressed through other methods

The Iridian evidentiality system more or less falls under \posscite{aikhenvald2004} A3 category, where the distinction is between the marked quotative form for reported speech/hearsay and the unmarked ‘everything else’ category which is evidentiality-neutral

\subsection{Quotative constructions and reported speech}\label{sec:quotative-const}

The principal use of the quotative is to explicitly mark reported speech. The reported clause is separated from the rest of the sentence by the particle \ird{to-že}.\footnote{In colloquial speech, \ird{to-\v{z}e} is often reduced to \ird{\v{c}e}, or less commonly \ird{d\v{z}e}.}

\pex
  \begingl
    \gla Koleč sní upolšice to-že Lukáš žiček.//
    \glb key \Refl{}.\Acc{} \Refl{}-lose-\Av{}-\Pf{}-\Quot{} {\Rel{}=\Quot{} (:=\Qp{})} Lukáš say-\Av{}-\Pf{}//
    \glft ‘Lukáš said he lost his keys.’//
  \endgl
\xe

The particle \ird{to-že} is in fact made up of two separate clitics: the particle \ird{to} which is used to mark relative clauses, and \ird{-že} which is the primary quotative particle. This is made more evident in nested quotations, where \ird{-že} can only be attached to the rightmost reported clause:

\pex
  \begingl
    \gla Dá dněm vednice to Marek žičice to-že Lukáš žiček.//
    \glb \First{}\Sg{} \Dem{}.\Agt{} see-\Pv{}-\Pf{}-\Quot{} \Rel{} Marek say-\Av{}-\Pf{}-\Quot{} \Qp{} Lukáš say-\Av{}-\Pf{}//
    \glft \trsl{Lukáš said Marek said he (Marek) saw me.}//
  \endgl
\xe


Direct quotations do not require the quotative, although they are still separated from the main clause by to-že.

\pex
  \begingl
    \gla „Dá záščenžit” to-že žiček.//
    \glb \First{}\Sg{} \Neg{}-come-\Av{}-\SupP{} \Qp{} say-\Av{}-\Pf{}//
    \glft \trsl{“I won’t be coming,” (he) said.}//
  \endgl
\xe



The use of pronouns in quoted clauses is similar to English, with the main exception being the use of the reflexive se if the subject of the quoted clause is the same as the subject of the main clause. This is true even if the subject of the main clause is a pronoun.

\pex
  \begingl
    \gla Se to obru na večera záščenžitej\'i to-že Marek (dá) žiček. //
    \glb \Refl{} \Dem{} night-\Ins{} \Loc{} party-\Acc{} \Neg{}-come-\Av{}-\SupP{}-\Quot{} \Qp{} Marek \First\Sg{} say-\Av{}-\Pf{} //
    \glft \trsl{Marek/I said he/I won't be coming to the party tonight.}//
  \endgl
\xe

The verb \irdp{zěká}{to say} is called a \emph{verbum dicendi}\index{verbum dicendi} from the Latin meaning ‘verb of speech/speaking.’ Other \emph{verba dicendi} in Iridian include \irdp{vadá}{to think}; \irdp{kvuštá}{to hear}; \irdp{vidá}{to see}; \irdp{hloupá}{to ask}; \irdp{ohletá}{to remember}; \irdp{sehová}{to recount, to tell a story}. Note that although they are called verbs ``of speaking'' they do not necessarily introduce speech as much as function as grammaticalized tags marking the quotative,  which is more properly analyzed to mark not just speech but inferentiality and evidentiality as well.

More complex \emph{verba dicendi} can be formed by using an imperfect converbial construction (the converb form in \ird{-\v{e}c}) with a canonical \emph{verbum dicendi}. To illustrate this consider the following sentences in English:

\pex[*=?*,interpartskip=0pt]
\a She said no.\deftagex{vd}\deftaglabel{1}
\a She whispered no.\deftaglabel{2}
\a She said no \emph{in a whisper}.\deftaglabel{3}
\a \ljudge{?} She said \emph{in a whisper} no.\deftaglabel{4}
\a \ljudge{??} She said \emph{whisperingly} no.\deftaglabel{5}
\xe

We see that both \emph{said} (\getfullref{vd.1}) and \emph{whispered} (\getfullref{vd.2}) are \emph{verba dicendi} in English. Nonetheless it's also obvious how \getfullref{vd.2} is simply a function of (\getfullref{vd.1}), i.e., we can express (\getfullref{vd.2}) in terms of (\getfullref{vd.1}), in this case using an adverbial construction (\trsl{in a whisper}) as we see in \getfullref{vd.3} or the more affected \getfullref{vd.4}. Finally using a simple adverbial is theoretically allowed in English (\getfullref{vd.5}), although as we see the resulting construction is rather unwieldy or unnatural-sounding.

In Iridian, however, constructions like (\getfullref{vd.2}) are not permitted, with preference given to adverbial (or more correctly, converbial)\index{converb} constructions. Thus we translate (\getfullref{vd.2}) as:

\pex
\begingl
\gla Ne to-že mišlec zíček.//
\glb no \mk{qp} whisper-\Cv{} say-\Av{}-\Pf{}//
\glft \trsl{(She) whispered no.}//
\endgl
\xe

It should be noted as well how the verb \irdp{vadá}{to think} and its derived forms, due to their inherent meanings, require the subjunctive to be used in the reported clause. This is true whether or not the subjunctive would have been used had the reported clause been a regular dependent clause.


\pex
\begingl
  \gla Já mnou nehlí to-že Martin spouv\v{e}c vážev\'i.//
  \glb you correct \Cop{}.\Sbj{}.\Quot{} \Qp{} Martin agree-\Cv{}.\Ipf{} think-\Av{}-\Cont{}//
  \glft \trsl{Martin agrees that you are right.}//
\endgl
\xe



We see from  that when it comes to reported speech and similar constructions in Iridian, the \ird{verbum dicendi}\index{verbum dicendi} is not necessary to create a well-formed sentence. The same is true with the quotative particle \ird{to-že}. Both can be omitted without making the sentence grammatically incorrect since the quotative particle is enough to identify the reported clause.\index{reported speech}.

In most instances, however, removing either the main verb or the main verb and the quotative particle can cause the resulting sentence to acquire a new meaning. This is especially true when the quotative mood is used not to report speech but to imply a certain unsureness on the part of the speaker about the information being presented, or for the speaker to distance themself by implying through the use of the quotative that the information is secondhand and not theirs. Generally \ird{to-že} is kept when the speaker is quoting themself, to repeat or emphasize what they have said, or expletively, to express their frustration or affirmation.

Interestingly, commands and requests are not treated as reported speech but as regular subordinate clauses governed by \ird{to} and not by \ird{to-že}.

When the quoted clause is a question, whether a direct one or not, the quoted clause is preceded by the particle \irdp{a}{and} and the word \irdp{ane}{whether} is used instead of \ird{to-že}. The word \ird{ane} is also used for verba dicendi that are interrogative in nature, such as \irdp{préhoustá}{to ask},

\pex
\begingl
  \gla A Janek zdalšice ane préhousček.//
  \glb and Janek have:breakfast-\Av{}-\Pf{}-\Quot{} whether ask-\Av{}-\Pf{}//
  \glft \trsl{(He) asked (me) whether Janek has had breakfast yet.}//
\endgl

  \glft \trsl{His fans are excited to know if he'll finish his book this year.
}//
\endgl
\xe

The quotative is also triggered by phrases introduced with \irdp{ty}{according to} or \irdp{záty}{contrary to,} with the latter requiring the subjunctive. 


\pex
\begingl
  \gla Messi a ty Marku debil neví.//

  \glft \trsl{Marek thinks Messi is a spaz.}//

  \glft \trsl{Against my mother’s wishes, I went to Wrocław to see my father.}//
\endgl
\xe


\subsection{Bare quotatives and clause linking}

Quoted clauses in Iridian may also appear without an overt predicate, as well as without being signalled by the quotative particle \ird{to-\v{z}e}. We will call this construction a {\sc bare quotative} after the terminology in \textcite{tomioka2019} in reference to embedded quotative constructions in Japanese and Korean without overt predicates. The term as originally used by these authors refer only to embedded quotatives in Japanese and Korean, but we will be using it to refer to both an unselected (i.e., predicateless) quotative in a subordinate clause (which we will call {\sc syntactic}) and in the main clause (which we will call {\sc semantic}).

The choice to call the second type a semantic bare quotative is motivated by the fact that an unselected quotative in the main clause is often used not to mark a speech act but to indicate the epistemic value of (viz., to pass the speaker's judgement on) a proposition. Nevertheless, we can still see it used as a true quotative, as when the omission of the predicate or the quotative particle is through mere ellipsis.

The first type, on the other hand, is mostly used as a clause-linking strategy. The quotative construction is still considered as a speech act, but, like converbial constructions or \ird{\v{s}e} clauses, the relationship between the main clause and the reported clause becomes interpreted as being one of causality, or at least of dependency, although of course this causality or dependency is only indirect, as we see in the examples below, where the embedded quotative and the simple \ird{\v{s}e} clause present to different interpretations.

\pex

    \glft \trsl{The rain having stopped, Marek began cleaning the garden.}//
  \endgl
\xe


\subsection{Epistemic extensions}

As in most other languages with an overt evidential system, the Iridian quotative has secondary epistemic extensions. This may be realised either by using the quotative by itself or through auxiliary epistemic markers. As we have established in the previous sections, the quotative can be used by a speaker both to distance themself from the statement on the one hand and to assert their belief in its truthfulness on the other; the use of a secondary epistemic marker eliminates this possible confusion in what would otherwise have been a contradictory usage of the same grammatical category. These auxiliary particles, nonetheless, may of course be left out in discourse if the speaker thinks the epistemic usage of the quotative is clear enough from the context.

A speaker’s judgement of the truthfulness of a statement may be made clear by the dubitative \ird{bude} or the affirmative \ird{toleto}. When using the quotative to quote oneself, \ird{bude} expresses a disbelief predicated upon surprise rather than on a judgement of a statement’s veracity; used the same way, \ird{toleto} acquires a secondary meaning of insistence, even annoyance.

\endgl
\xe


A speaker’s uncertainty may also be expressed using the quotative even when the statement directly came from the speaker. The uncertainty may refer to both the factuality of the statement or to its source. This strategy is used to signal the speaker’s emotional or cognitive distance from the event. This may be further complemented by the particle \ird{iz} which we will glossing here as \Rep{} for reportative but only for the sake of convenience, in order to distinguish the various auxiliary particles we have introduced here, as the “reportative” does not exist as a true grammatical category in Iridian for our purposes. \ird{Iz} implies a greater degree of disjunction between the speaker and the statement than the plain quotative. Although it does not pass a judgement on the truth value of the statement as do \ird{dube} or \ird{toleto}, \ird{iz} makes it clear that the statement did not come from the speaker and that the responsibility for the statement does not lie on them. \ird{Iz} is particularly common in newscasts or in other formal settings where the speaker is communicating statements from another speaker or group and the identity of the speaker or group has already been established earlier in the conversation and is thus known to everyone.

According to its spokesperson, the ministry is currently not in talks with Russia and has not sanctioned the reported Deputy Minister's recent visit to Moscow. It is now investigating the allegations and has asked Deputy Minister Novak to submit a brief to the Minister to explain his actions.}}
\xe

Uncertainty on the truthfulness of the statement may also be expressed using the inferential particles \ird{bylo} and \ird{atole}. Whereas \ird{iz} raises the question of the character of the source and is neutral as to the speaker’s commitment to it (although one can be understood simply by pointing out the fact that the source is something other than oneself to be effectively passing judgement) both \ird{bylo} and \ird{atole} reflect the speaker’s judgement. \ird{Bylo} in general is used when the proposition is coming from the speaker themself while \ird{atole} is used when the speaker thinks that the statement can be inferred from the surrounding facts.

\section{Relative and comparative constructions}\label{relativecomparative}\index{comparative construction}

The clitic\index{clitic} \ird{tám} is used to form simple comparative and relative constructions. \ird{Tám} is often ommitted where the comparison can be implied from context. In this construction, the standard of comparison\index{standard of comparison} (the noun preceded by `than' in English\index{English}) is unmarked and the noun being compared marked in the agentive\index{agentive case} if it is a positive/negative comparison, or in the instrumental\index{instrumental case} if it is a correlation.


\pex
\a\begingl
\gla Janek(-tám) Markám nestaževí.//
\glb Janek Marek-\Agt{} tall-\mk{cont}//
\glft \trsl{Marek is taller than Janek.}//
\endgl
\a\begingl
\gla Janek(-tám) Marku nestaževí.//
\glb Janek Marek-\Ins{} tall-\mk{cont}//
\glft \trsl{Marek is as tall as Janek.}//
\endgl
\xe

Note that \ird{tám} can only be used with the copulative form of the stative verb\index{stative verb}, as the attributive and nominal forms have separate conjugated comparative forms. When using these forms, however, the standard of comparison is marked in the genitive\index{genitive case}. In relative constructions, the instrumental\index{instrumental case} is also replaced with the genitive\index{genitive case}, but the modifier \ird{zní}, \trsl{same} is added before the stative verb\index{stative verb}.

\pex
\a
\begingl
\gla Jancí nestašení hloc mlazka.//
\glb Janek-\Gen{} tall-\Comp{}-\Att{} boy brother-\Dim{}//
\glft \trsl{The boy who is taller than Janek is my brother} (\emph{Lit.,} \trsl{The taller-than-Janek boy is my brother.})//
\endgl
\a
\begingl
\gla Jancí zní nestažení hloc mlazka.//
\glb Janek-\Gen{} same tall-\Comp{}-\Att{} boy brother-\Dim{}//
\glft \trsl{The boy who is as tall as Janek is my brother.}//
\endgl
\xe

\ird{Tám} can be relativized by appending the clitic\index{clitic} \ird{to}. When used with \ird{tám-to} the standard of comparison is marked in the patientive case\index{patientive case}. The use of tám-to in relative clauses is discussed in further detail in the next chapter.

\ex
\begingl
\gla Viktor na shlopa tám-to nestážek.//

\glft \trsl{the pet [of the person who was made happier than Marek]}//
\endgl
\xe

Iridian does not have a morphologically distinct superlative construction. For example, \ird{pizdení} (from \ird{pizdá}, \trsl{to be big}) can either mean \trsl{bigger} or \trsl{biggest} depending on context. Where the meaning cannot be easily implied from context, the word \ird{ohnu} (derived from the word \ird{ohna}, \trsl{first} in the instrumental case) is often used as quantifier.

\pex
\a
\begingl
\gla Univerzitet na razmeka pizdenou.//
\glb university \Loc{} city-\Acc{} be:big-\Comp{}-\Nz{}//
\glft \trsl{(This) university is the biggest in the city.}//

\glb university \Loc{} city-\Acc{} first-\Ins{} be:big-\Comp{}-\Nz{}//
\glft \trsl{(This) university is the biggest in the city.}//
\endgl
\xe

When using an adverbial construction with the instrumental case to modify or quantify the comparison, the adverbial phrase must immediately precede the stative verb if in the attributive or nominal form, or the particle \ird{tám} otherwise. The same is true with invariable modifiers like \ird{nahte}, \trsl{too much}, \ird{dnu}, \trsl{a bit}, etc.

\ex
\begingl
\gla To bagáž jánám u 10 kilográmu tám prékveví.//

\section{Specific construction types}
\subsection{Questions}\index{questions!syntax of}\index{interrogative sentence|see{questions!syntax of}}

There are two  main  categories  of  interrogative  sentences in Iridian: yes-no  and  question-word questions (or \emph{wh-}questions).

\subsubsection{Yes-no questions}\index{questions!yes-no}\index{questions!syntax of}

A declarative sentence can be made into a question by a simple rise in intonation at the end of the phrase:

\pex
\a
\begingl
\gla Janek ža uzdravšek.//
\glb Janek already \Refl{}-sleep-\Av{}-\Pf{}//
\glft \trsl{Janek has fallen asleep.}//
\endgl
\a
\begingl
\gla Janek ža uzdravšek?//
\glb Janek already \Refl{}-sleep-\Av{}-\Pf{}//
\glft \trsl{Has Janek fallen asleep yet?}//
\endgl
\xe

Yes-no questions, especially longer ones, may also be formed using the clitic \ird{no}, which immediately follows the element of the sentence being questioned. To question the sentence as a whole, \ird{no} sentence-initially. \ird{No} may also appear after other elements of the sentence, but the resulting word order is generally more emphatic and often includes promoting the element where \ird{no} to the topic position and the nominalisation of the resulting verb phrase if possible.


\pex
\a Sentence-initial \ird{no}:\\
  \begingl
  \gla No Balžaróma Europevní Unijí čelina?//
  \glb \Q{} Bulgaria European-\Att{} Union-\Gen{} member//
  \glft \trsl{Is Bulgaria a member of the European Union?}//
  \endgl
\a Cliticised \ird{no}:\\
  \begingl
  \gla Janek zmáčime-no?//
  \glb Janek run-\Av{}-\Prog{}=\Q{}//
  \glft \trsl{Is it running that Janek is doing now?}//
  \endgl
\a Cliticised \ird{no} triggering topicalisation of questioned element:\\
  \begingl
  \gla Janek-no zmáčimou?//
  \glb Janek=\Q{} run-\Av{}-\Prog{}-\Nz{}//
  \glft \trsl{Is it Janek who is running now?}//
  \endgl
\xe

\irdp{Ane}{whether} may also be used instead of \ird{no} to indicate uncertainty on the part of the speaker, or in polite or formal speech, to avoid asking a direct question. \ird{Ane} functions the same way as \ird{no} and may be used sentence initially or as a clitic.

\pex
\a\begingl
  \gla Ane Stám Kovárž niehu na sésta o leguánu hvaružnašách?//
  \glb whether mister Kovárž later-\Ins{} \Loc{} convention-\Acc{} about iguana-\Ins{} give:a:speech-\Av{}-\Ctp{}//
  \glft \trsl{Would Mr Kovárž be giving a speech about iguanas later at the convention?}//
  \endgl
\a\begingl
  \gla Stám Kovárž-ane niehu na sésta o leguánu hvaružnašit?//
  \glb mister Kovárž=whether later-\Ins{} \Loc{} convention-\Acc{} about iguana-\Ins{} give:a:speech-\Av{}-\Sup{}//
  \glft \trsl{Would it be Mr Kovárž who will be giving a speech about iguanas later at the convention?}//
  \endgl
\xe

To make an existential sentence\index{existential construction} a yes-no question, it is first transformed to the negative and the particle \ird{no/ane} is then attached to the word \ird{niho}. If however, the theme of the sentence is quantified, the word \ird{ješ}\index{ješ@\emph{ješ}} is kept (but shifted to the front of the quantifier), and \ird{no} is attached to the quantifier. The form \ird{ješ-no} is ungrammatical. A sentence-initial \ird{no/ane} cannot be used in transforming an existential construction.

\pex
\begingl
\gla Marka niho-no oblašc?//
\glb Marek-\Acc{} \N{}\Exst{}=\Q{} pet//
\glft \trsl{Does Marek have a pet?}//
\endgl
\xe

\pex
\a
\begingl
\gla Co bibliotéc\v{e} Marka hroná ješ kupénenik ko tóm.//
\glb \Abl{} library-\Gen{} Marek-\Acc{} three \Exst{} borrow-\Pv{}-\Pf{} \Lnk{} book//
\glft \trsl{Marek borrowed three books from the library.}//
\endgl
\a
\begingl
\gla Co bibliotéc\v{e} Marka ješ hroná-no kupénenik ko tóm?//
\glb \Abl{} library-\Gen{} Marek-\Acc{} \Exst{} three=\Q{} borrow-\Pv{}-\Pf{} \Lnk{} book//
\glft \trsl{Did Marek borrow three books from the library.}//
\endgl
\xe

Tag questions may be formed by appending the phrase \irdp{no/ane zám le\v{t}}{isn't it the truth} (cf. Russian\index{Russian} \foreign{не правда ли}) to the end of the sentence. In colloquial speech, it is also common to simply use \irdp{da}{yes} instead.

\pex
\begingl
\gla Traví kupénžek, no zám le\v{t}? /da?//
\glb bread-\Gen{} buy-\Av{}-\Pf{} \Q{}= \Neg{}= truth yes//
\glft \trsl{You bought some bread, didn't you? /right?}//
\endgl
\xe

\subsubsection{Content questions}\index{wh-question@\emph{wh-}question}\index{information question|see{\emph{wh}-question}}\index{content question|see{\emph{wh}-question}}

Content questions, also known as \emph{wh}-questions, are formed using the interrogative pronouns \irdp{jede}{who,} \irdp{ježe}{what,} \irdp{jena}{where,} etc.\footnote{
  A full list of interrogative pronouns can be found in \S~\ref{sec:int-pron}.
} Iridian requires the \emph{wh}-phrase to be moved to the beginning of the sentence, thus causing it to occupy the topic position. This \emph{wh}-fronting\index{wh-fronting@\emph{wh}-fronting} consequently causes the voice of the main verb to be reframed to accomodate the new topic. More commonly, especially colloquial Iridian\index{colloquial Iridian}, this also means the nominalisation\index{nominalisation} of the main verb phrase, essentially making the question an equational sentence.

\pex
\a\begingl
\gla Karel na Roubžení verštáta možlaševí.//
\glb Karel \Loc{} Roubže-\Gen{} suburbs-\Acc{} live-\Av{}-\Cont{}//
\glft \trsl{Karel lives in the suburbs of Roubže.}//
\endgl
\a\begingl
\gla Jena Karlám možlouneví? /možlounívou?//
\glb where Karel-\Agt{} live-\Lv{}-\Cont{} live-\Lv{}-\Cont{}-\Nz{} //
\glft \trsl{Where does Karel live?}//
\endgl
\xe

Alternatively, the element being questioned may be replaced with a question word without changing the original word order, in which case the addition of the clitic \ird{no} is required. Note that questions formed this way generally have a more emphatic meaning.

\pex
\begingl
\gla Karel jena-no možlaševí?//
\glb Karel where=\Q{} live-\Av{}-\Cont{}//
\glft \trsl{Where did you say Karel lived?}//
\endgl
\xe


\emph{Wh}-fronting may sometimes cause peripheral elements of a phrase to be moved together with the \emph{wh}-item to the beginning of the sentence, a phenomenon linguists call `pied-piping' (\cite[263-4]{ross1967}). When this occurs, Iridian is more conservative than English in that it usually keeps the same question word instead of replacing it with a specialized one (in English, normally, `which'); it may, however, use \irdp{jak}{which} if the expected answer to the question is an element of a class, i.e., not unique. Consider, for example, the two questions below:

%%%% zuscve, cf. Cz sodestvi, Ru. sodestvo
\pex
\a
\begingl
\gla Jena zuscve možlounívou?//
\glb where neighborhood live-\Lv{}-\Cont{}-\Nz{}//
\glft \trsl{Which (\emph{lit.,} where) neighborhood do you live in?}//
\endgl
\a
\begingl
\gla Jak kvartír možlounívou?//
\glb which apartment live-\Lv{}-\Cont{}-\Nz{}//
\glft \trsl{Which of these apartments is the you live in?}//
\endgl
\xe

In cases where there are multiple \emph{wh}-elements in the sentences, they are normally all fronted, with the main question word first followed by the rest in order of importance. Interestingly, too, any or all of the fronted \emph{wh}-items may be pluralised with \ird{ně} if the speaker expects that the answer is plural.

\pex
\a\begingl
\gla Jede ježe jena hloupškou?//
\glb who what where ask-\Av{}-\Pf{}-\Nz{}//
\glft \trsl{Who asked what where?}//
\endgl
\a\begingl
\gla Ně jede ježe jena hloupškou?//
\glb \Pl{}= who what where ask-\Av{}-\Pf{}-\Nz{}//
\glft \trsl{Which persons asked what where?}//
\endgl
\a\begingl
\gla Jede ně ježe jena hloupškou?//
\glb who \Pl{}= what where ask-\Av{}-\Pf{}-\Nz{}//
\glft \trsl{Who asked what things where?}//
\endgl
\xe

In the case of more complex \emph{wh}-questions involving the movement of a \emph{wh}-item from an embedded clause, Iridian is similar to Bulgarian\footnote{
  \posscite{rudin1988} description on the nature of multiple \emph{wh}-fronting in Bulgarian\index{Bulgarian} involves the movement of the \emph{wh}-item to closest interrogative SpecCP, which does not necessarily need to occupy the topic position in the sentence. Compare, for example the following sentences in Bulgarian and Iridian.

  \ex[lingstyle=fnex,belowexskip=-1em,aboveglftskip=1pt]
  Bulgarian\index{Bulgarian} (\emph{ibid.,} 451)\smallskip\\
    \begingl 
    \gla Boris na kogo kakvo kaza [če šte {dade --- ---]}? //
    \glb Boris to whom what said that will give-\Third{}\Sg{}//
    \glft \trsl{What did Boris say that (he) would give to whom?}//
  \endgl
  \xe
\smallskip
  \ex[lingstyle=fnex,belowexskip=-1em,aboveglftskip=1pt]
    \begingl 
    \gla Ježe jehát Borisám dejatnách to zíknou?//
    \glb what to:whom Boris-\Agt{} give-\Pv{}-\Ctp{} \Rz{} say-\Pv{}-\Pf{}-\Nz{}//
    \glft \trsl{What did Boris say that (he) would give to whom?}//
  \endgl
  \xe

} in requiring all the \emph{wh}-items to be fronted (cf.~\cite[450]{rudin1988}).

\pex
\begingl
\gla Ježe jehát dejatnách to zíknou?//
\glb what to:whom give-\Pv{}-\Ctp{} \Rz{} say-\Pv{}-\Pf{}-\Nz{}//
\glft \trsl{What did she say that she will give to whom?}//
\endgl
\xe


\subsubsection{Indirect questions}

Indirect questions are constructed in the subjunctive, with the addition of the particle \ird{aš}.

\pex
\begingl
\gla Nú aš hošezíla.//
\glb tomorrow \mk{q.ind} rain\mk{av-sbj.ipf}.//
\glft \trsl{I wonder if it's gonna rain tomorrow.}//
\endgl
\xe

\subsubsection{Answering questions}\label{sec:ansyn}

Most yes-no questions may be answered by repeating the focal word or phrase in the original question or echoing the syntax of the question itself.

\ex
\vtop{\halign{%
#\hfil& \qquad #\hfil\cr
\ird{---\,Kartuškí tak slouveževí?} & \trsl{\small Do they sell potatoes here?}\cr
\ird{---\,Slouveževí?} & \trsl{\small They do.}\cr
}}
\xe

Alternatively, the question may be answered by \irdp{da}{yes} or \irdp{ne}{no,} both of which have been adapted from Common Slavic\index{Common Slavic}. In colloquial speech it is also common to use \ird{já} or \ird{jó} for \trsl{yes} (most likely borrowings from German\index{German}). These polarity words may be used alone or in combination with the echo response. In general, the order does not matter, although it is more common for the polarity word to appear after the echo response. Unlike English \trsl{yes,} \ird{da} is used when confirming the question posed by the speaker, whether or not it is in the affirmative or in the negative. When denying or negating a question, Iridian uses \ird{ne} is used when the original question was framed in the negative and \ird{ale} otherwise.

\ex
\vtop{\halign{%
#\hfil\hfil\cr
\ird{---\,Lošní Nolaní vilm ža oudnenik?}\cr
\ird{---\,\v{Z}a oudnenik, da. Má záčesčik.}\cr
\ird{---\,Ne, po zoudnenik.}\smallskip\cr
\trsl{Have you seen Nolan's new film?}\cr
\trsl{I've seen it, yes. But I didn't like it.}\cr
\trsl{No, I haven't seen it yet.}\cr
}}\xe

\ex\vtop{\halign{%
#\hfil\hfil\cr
\ird{---\,No daní trehlo za banka podarnílá to-že Janek záléháček?}\cr
\ird{---\,Léháček, ale. Má avtem bych hebo.}\cr
\ird{---\,Záléháček, da.}\smallskip\cr
\trsl{Weren't you advised by Janek to submit your tax return to the bank?}\cr
\trsl{He did, yes. But my car broke down yesterday.}\cr
\trsl{No, he didn't advise me to.}\cr
}}
\xe

\ird{Da} (or sometimes \ird{a da}) may also preface answers to questions as a form of intensifier, or to indicate that the speaker considers the answer to the question as an obvious truth.

\ex
\vtop{\halign{%
#\hfil& \qquad #\hfil\cr
\ird{---\,Na muzla ješ vdenikou.} & \trsl{I saw someone at the mall today.}\cr
\ird{---\,Jede?} & \trsl{Who?}\cr
\ird{---\,Da Janek.} & \trsl{Well, Janek, of course.}\cr
}}\xe

The answer does not need to be positive for \ird{da} or \ird{a da} to be used.

\ex\vtop{\halign{%
#\hfil\hfil\cr
\ird{---\,\v{S}abatu de koncerta stožit?}\cr
\ird{---\,A da ne. To kapela šem záčesčeví.}\smallskip\cr
\trsl{Are you coming to the concert on Saturday?}\cr
\trsl{Well no, I don't even like that band.}\cr
}}
\xe


As for questions involving existential constructions


\subsection{Negation}\index{negation}

In Iridian sentences, negation is performed by the particle \ird{zám}, which attaches to the beginning of the word or phrase  it negates. The default position of the negative particle is usually before the main verb where it surfaces as \ird{z-} before vowels, \ird{ž-} before \emph{i}-glides, and \ird{zá-} elswehere.

\pex
\a
\begingl
    \gla Janek Martina Markám {zá}hévoržébik.//
    \glb Janek Martin-\Acc{} Marek-\Agt{} \Neg{}know-\Ben{}-\Pf{}//
    \glft \trsl{Marek did not introduce Janek to Martin.}//
\endgl
\a
\begingl
    \gla {Zám} Janek Martina Markám hévoržébik.//
    \glb \Neg{} Janek Martin-\Acc{} Marek-\Agt{} know-\Ben{}-\Pf{}//
    \glft \trsl{It was not Janek whom Marek introduced to Martin.}//
\endgl
\a
\begingl
    \gla Janek {zám} Martina Markám hévoržébik.//
    \glb Janek \Neg{} Martin-\Acc{} Marek-\Agt{} know-\Ben{}-\Pf{}//

    \glb Janek Martin-\Acc{} \Neg{} Marek-\Agt{} know-\Ben{}-\Pf{}//
    \glft \trsl{It was not Marek who introduced Janek to Martin.}//
\endgl
\xe

It is also common, especially in spoken Iridian, to append the clitic \ird{-te}
after the word being negated by \ird{zám} (i.e., if the negative clitic is not
in the default position before the main verb) to provide more emphasis on the
negation.

\pex
\a
\begingl
    \gla {Zám} Janek{-te} Martina Markám hévoržébik.//
    \glb \Neg{} Janek=\Foc{} Martin-\Acc{} Marek-\Agt{} know-\Ben{}-\Pf{}//

    \glft \trsl{It was not Marek who introduced Janek to Martin.}//
\endgl
\xe

The different constituents of the sentence can be negated simultaneously; thus,
for example, the sentence below is grammatically permitted:

\pex
\begingl
    \gla {Zám} Janek {zám} Martina {zám} Markám {zá}hévoržébik.//
    \glb \Neg{} Janek \Neg{} Martin-\Acc{} \Neg{} Marek-\Agt{} \Neg{}-know-\Ben{}-\Pf{}//
    \glft \trsl{It was not Janek who was not introduced to someone who is not Martin by someone who is not Marek.}//

Nonetheless, due to their general unwieldiness, forms like this are extremely
rare (both in the spoken and the written language), with preference given to
single and double negation instead. Since \ird{-te} can only appear in a
sentence once, where there are more than one negate constituent in a sentence,
\ird{-te} is appended to the element which has the most significance (usually
the topic); or, if there are two constituents negated and one of them is the
main verb, \ird{-te} is appended to that other element.

\begingl
    \gla {Zám} Janek{-te} Martina Markám {zá}hévoržébik.//
    \glb \Neg{} Janek=\Foc{} Martin-\Acc{} Marek-\Agt{} \Neg{}know-\Ben{}-\Pf{}//
    \glft \trsl{It was not Janek who was not introduced to Martin by Marek.}//
\endgl
\xe

Alternatively, if there is only one element/phrase negated in the sentence other than the main verb (which itself may or may not be negated), it is common, especially in colloquial Iridian\index{colloquial Iridian}, to nominalize\index{nominalization} the whole verb phrase and transform the sentence into a copular construction\index{copular construction}, with the negated phrase as the new topic\index{topic} and the nominalized verb phrase as the predicate\index{predicate}.

\subsection{Existential construction}\index{existential construction}
\label{sec:exst}

\subsubsection{In general}
An existential sentence is a specialized construction used to express the existence or presence of someone or something. The particle \ird{ješ} and its inverse \ird{niho} are used to form existential sentences. 
\begin{multicols}{2}
\pex
\a\begingl
\gla Tak ješ zarno.//
\glb here \Exst{} people//
\glft \trsl{There are people here.}//
\endgl
\a\begingl
\gla Tak niho zarno.//
\glb here \N{}\Exst{} people//
\glft \trsl{There is no one here.}//
\endgl
\xe
\end{multicols}

The existential construction in Iridian was originally a locative\index{locative} one, and this could still be seen in how the use of \ird{ješ} and \ird{niho} requires both the noun or noun phrase whose existence is posited and the location where such existence is said to be true to be explicitly present in the sentence. In true existential sentences (e.g., \trsl{There is a God} or \trsl{There is still hope}) where the argument is the existence of something and not just it's mere presence somewhere, the patientive form of the reflexive verb \ird{se}, \ird{sní}, is used. In addition, where this ostensible location is present in the sentence, it would occupy the topic\index{topic} position\footnote{Although this location (often surfacing as a \ird{na} clause) appears where the topic of the sentence normally would, it would be more correct to analyze an existential construction as an inversion of the regular topic-predicate word order in Iridian. Viewed this way, we can think of \ird{ješ} or \ird{niho} as a pseudoverb, and the phrase consisting of the first half of the sentence and ending with this pseudoverb is the predicate while the unmarked second half is the topic. This approach has the benefit of keeping the predicate with a verb-final internal word order and the topic as unmarked, both in accordance with the basic rules of Iridian syntax; however, this does not account for the use of the dummy \ird{sní} in true existential clauses.} in the sentence, and unlike in regular sentences, must be explicitly marked in the patientive.\index{patientive}


\begin{multicols}{2}
\pex
\a\begingl
\gla \ljudge{*}Ješ tieho.//
\glb \Exst{} god//
\glft \trsl{There is a God.}//
\endgl
\a\begingl
\gla Sní ješ tieho.//
\glb \Refl{}.\Acc{} \Exst{} god//
\glft \trsl{There is a God.}//
\endgl
\xe
\end{multicols}

The use of \ird{sní} as a placeholder is not required however if the noun or noun phrase whose existence is the subject of the sentence is quantified, either by a numeral or otherwise by an indefinite quantifier.

Statements expressing location use a copular construction, although an existential construction is used in the negative.

\pex
\begingl
\gla Dá na duma.//
\glb \mk{1s.str} \Loc{} house-\Acc{}//
\glft \trsl{I'm at home.}//
\endgl
\xe

\pex
\begingl
\gla Na duma niho dá.//
\glb \Loc{} house-\Acc{} \N{}\Exst{} \mk{1s.str}//
\glft \trsl{I'm not at home.}//
\endgl
\xe

The particles \ird{ješ} and \ird{niho} must always precede the noun whose presence or existence is being expressed.

\pex
\begingl
\gla Na ránema ona ješ htoš.//
\glb \Loc{} desk-\mk{1s-pat} one \Exst{} book//
\glft \trsl{There is one book on my desk.}//
\endgl
\xe

\pex
\begingl
\gla M\"y ješ mulaž.//
\glb two \Exst{} door//
\glft \trsl{There are two doors.}//
\endgl
\xe



\subsubsection{Possession}
Existential constructions are also used to indicate possession, with the possessor marked in the patientive case.

\begin{multicols}{2}
\pex
  \begingl
    \gla Marka ješ oblašc.//
    \glb Marek-\Acc{} \Exst{} pet//
    \glft \trsl{Marek has a pet.}//
  \endgl
\xe
\pex
  \begingl
    \gla Tomáša niho mlaz.//
    \glb Tomáš-\Acc{} \N{}\Exst{} brother//
    \glft \trsl{Tomáš does not have a brother.}//
  \endgl
\xe
\end{multicols}

\subsubsection{Impersonal constructions}\index{impersonal construction}

Iridian prefers using existential constructions where English\index{English} and other Indo-European languages would use indefinite pronouns. More formally, sentences of this type are called impersonal constructions.\footnote{See, for example, \textcite{lawtagalog} where the discussion in this section is largely based.} In general an impersonal construction in Iridian is produced by nominalizing\index{nominalization} a verb phrase which would otherwsise have been the predicate of an indefinite pronoun. We can illustrate this in English as follows:

\pex
\a  \deftagex{impeng}\deftaglabel{ind}Sentence with an indefinite pronoun as subject:\\
    \emph{Somebody} told me to come here to pick up the dress.
\a  Impersonal construction:\\
    \ljudge{?}\emph{There is somebody} who told me to come here to pick up the dress.
\xe

Sentences of the first type do not exist in Iridian. Instead sentences with an indefinite element (not necessarily the subject of the sentence) are reframed as existential constructions. To further illustrate the primacy of impersonal constructions over indefinite pronouns in Iridian, we can replace the subject of (\getfullref{impeng.ind}) with a definite noun:

\pex
\a\begingl
    \gla Tak muž nedvačernilá te Tereza ziček.//
    \glb here dress \Caus{}-get-\Pv{}-\Subj{}.\Ipf{} so:that Tereza say-\Av{}-\Pf{}//
    \glft \trsl{Tereza told me to come here to pick up the dress.}//
  \endgl
\a\begingl
    \gla Do ješ tak muž nedvačernilá te zičkou.//
    \glb \First{}\Sg{}.\Acc{} \Exst{} here dress \Caus{}-get-\Pv{}-\Subj{}.\Ipf{} so:that say-\Av{}-\Pf{}-\Nz{}//
    \glft \trsl{Somebody told me to come here to pick up the dress.} (\emph{Lit.,} I have someone who said (I) should come pick up the dress.)//
  \endgl
\xe


\pex
\begingl
\gla Martina ješ trešnikou na tropa.//
\glb Martin-\Acc{} \Exst{} write-\mk{pv-pf-nz} \Loc{} wall-\Acc{}//
\glft \trsl{Martin wrote something on the wall.}//
\endgl
\xe

\pex
\begingl
\gla Voštnikouva ža ješ piaščkou?//
\glb cook-\mk{pv-pf-nz-pat} already \Exst{} eat-\mk{av-pf-nz}//
\glft \trsl{Did somebody eat what (I) cooked?}//
\endgl
\xe

\subsection{Copular constructions}
\subsubsection{Null copula}

Copular sentences are a minor sentence type where the predicate is not a verb. For the purposes of this grammar, we narrow down our definition of copular constructions to the following:
\pex
\a \textit{Equative:} Marek is the doctor (we are talking about).
\a \textit{Inclusive:} Marek is a doctor.
\a \textit{Attributive:} Marek is tall.
\a \textit{Locative:} Marek is in the hospital.
\xe

Iridian does not make a distinction between equative, inclusive and attributive clauses. Locative clauses on the other hand, may be expressed using a copular or an existential construction, as will be discussed in this section.

Iridian is a superficially a zero-copula language and the most common way to form copular sentences is mere juxtaposition.

\pex<cop>
\begingl
\gla Marek doktor.//
\glb Marek doctor//
\glft \trsl{Marek (is a/the) doctor.}//
\endgl
\xe

The above example could either be taken to mean (1) Marek is a doctor (inclusive), or (2) Marek is the doctor (equative). Generally, though, Iridian uses word order to distinguish between equative and inclusive clauses.

\pex
\a \textit{Inclusive:} \{item in class\}\tss{N} $\varnothing$ \{class\}\tss{P}
\a \textit{Equative:} \{class\}\tss{N} $\varnothing$ \{item class\}\tss{P}
\xe

To avoid ambiguity, Example \getref{cop} can be reformulated to either of the following sentences:

\pex<cop1>
\a
\begingl
\gla Marek doktor.//
\glb Marek doctor//
\glft \trsl{Marek is a doctor.}//
\endgl

\a
\begingl
\gla Doktor Marek.//
\glb doctor Marek//
\glft \trsl{Marek is the doctor.}//
\endgl

\xe

The inversion of word order is not strongly grammaticalized with NP-NP sentences, i.e., both sentences in Example \getref{cop1} can still be used interchangeably without a change in meaning and preference is given on the one over the other when there is an ambiguity. This is not the case with attributive clauses, i.e., sentences with adjective or adjective phrase predicates. Consider for example the sentence below:

\pex
\begingl
\gla Marek rázym.//
\glb Marek tall//
\glft \trsl{Marek is tall.}//
\endgl
\xe

Inverting the word order of the sentence above would change the adjective to a substantive since modifiers cannot occupy the topic position.

\pex
\begingl
\gla Rázym Marek.//
\glb tall Marek//
\glft \trsl{The tall one is Marek.}//
\endgl
\xe

Iridian also distinguishes between attributive clauses expressing permanent conditions and clauses expressing temporary conditions, with the latter being expressed using existential constructions in certain adjectives.

\pex
\begingl
\gla *Marek morec.//
\glb Marek hungry//
\glft \trsl{Marek is hungry}//
\endgl
\xe


\pex
\begingl
\gla Marka ješ morec.//
\glb Marek-\Acc{} \Exst{} hunger//
\glft \trsl{Marek is hungry}//
\endgl
\xe

A full list of adjectives/modifiers that use the existential construction can be found in the section~\ref{sec:exst}.

The copula, however, cannot be ommitted in grammatical moods other than the indicative.

\subsubsection{Negative copula}

Iridian has the negative copula \ird{česná}.

\pex
\begingl
\gla Marek doktor česná.//
\glb Marek doctor \mk{cop.neg}//
\glft \trsl{Marek is not (a/the) doctor.}//
\endgl
\xe

\par The inversion of word order may also be used when one wants to avoid ambiguity:

\pex
\begingl
\gla Doktor Marek česná.//
\glb doctor Marek \mk{cop.neg}//
\glft \trsl{Marek is not the doctor.}//
\endgl
\xe
