\section{Introduction}

Verbs in Iridian are heavily marked. There is a tendency to encode most of the
information contained in the sentence on the verb leaving the noun or noun
phrase unmarked if possible. 

Finite verbs are marked\index{markedness} for the following grammatical
categories\index{grammatical categories}:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item {\sc aspect}.\index{aspect} Iridian has three primary aspects:
	perfective, imperfective and contemplative; and two secondary ones:
	retrospective and prospective.
	\item {\sc voice}.\index{voice} Iridian has a strong tendency to leave the
	topic of the sentence unmarked, instead encoding the primary information on
	the verb. Due to this, voice must be explicitly marked on the verb. Iridian
	has the following grammatical voices: agentive, patientive, benefactive,
	instrumental, locative and reflexive.
	\item {\sc mood and modality}.\index{mood} Besides the unmarked indicative,
	Iridian has the following grammatical moods: imperative, hortative, and
	conditional. The following modalities are also marked in the verb:
	potential, dubitative, and desiderative.
	\item {\sc valency}.\index{valency} Iridian distinguishes between causative
	and non-causative verbs as well as volitive and non-volitive actions.
	\item {\sc evidentiality}.\index{evidentiality} Iridian formally
	distinguishes between reported and non-reported information, although actual
	usage of the former often encompasses various semantic and not strictly
	evidentiality-related applications.
\end{enumerate}

Verbs are also marked for person, although this is done by the addition of
clitic pronouns and not through a separate conjugation paradigm. In most cases,
however, this is left out, especially if clear from the context. Iridian verbs
are not marked for tense, gender, or number.

Iridian verbs have four classes of non-finite forms: the gerund, the converb,
the supine and the generic nominal formed with \ird{-ou}. The non-finite verb
forms are derived from the uninflected verb stem except the generic nominal in
\ird{-ou} which can only be formed from a fully-inflected verb stem. A fifth
class exists--the infinitive--but this form is largely defunct and is only used
in certain compound constructions. Infinitives end in \ird{-á} and is used as
the citation form of a verb.

\section{Verb stem and order of inflectional affixes}\index{citation
form}\index{infinitive}


\subsection{The verb stem}\index{verb stem}

The {\scshape citation form} (or {\scshape dictionary form}\index{dictionary
form|see{citation form}} or {\scshape lemma}\index{lemma|see{citation form}}) of
a verb is the uninflected {\scshape infinitive}\index{infinitive}, a fossilized
form rarely used outside of a very few periphrastic\index{periphrasis} and
historical constructions (see \S\,\ref{sec:infinitive}). The infinitive ends
with the vowel \ird{-á}, and removing this ending will produce the {\scshape
verb stem}\index{verb stem}. The final consonant  of the stem is called the
thematic consonant\index{thematic consonant} and determines the conjugation
paradigm the verb follows. The verb stem is a bound form and must always appear
with at least one inflectional suffix.

\subsection{Sound changes}\label{sec:sound-changes}

Verb stems are normally classified into five groups (called {\scshape classes})
based on how their thematic consonant changes in unstable positions;
specifically, since the verb stem most often interacts with the suffixes used in
marking grammatical voice, these classes are based on how the stem changes when
followed by a sibilant suffix (as in the active voice) or a palatalising suffix
(as in the passive voice). The five classes are as follows: 
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
	\item Class I verbs include verbs with a thematic \ird{-t, -k, -c} and
	\ird{-č}. They all merge to \ird{-č} in the active voice
	(\ird{piašt-}\,→\,\ird{piašč-}) but remain stable when followed by a
	palatalising suffix, except \ird{-c} and \ird{-č} which merge to [t͡ɕ]
	although this is not reflected orthographically.
	\item Class II verbs include verbs with a thematic \ird{-s} or \ird{š},
	which both merge to [ɕ] in oth the active and passive voice, although only
	the former is reflected orthographically. 
	\item Class II-A (or Class IV) verbs are the smallest group and include
	verbs with a thematic \ird{-l} or {-p}. They use the suffix \ird{-š} in the
	active voice (\ird{dal-}\,→\,\ird{dalš-}) and are stable elsewhere.
	\item Class III verbs include verbs with a thematic \ird{-d, -g, -h, -j, -z}
	and \ird{-ž}. They all merge to \ird{-ž} in the active voice
	(\ird{vad-}\,→\,\ird{váž-}); they remain stable when followed by a
	palatalising suffix, except \ird{-z} and \ird{-ž} which merge to [ʑ]
	although this is again not reflected orthographically.
	\item Class III-A (or Class V) verbs include those ending with the remaining
	thematic consonants. They use the suffix \ird{-ž} in the active voice
	(\ird{ščen-}\,→\,\ird{ščenž-}) and are stable elsewhere.
\end{enumerate}

This classification is notwithstanding the fact that if the thematic consonant
is immediately after one or more consonants (except a lateral) an epenthetic
\ird{-a-} is added and the suffix -\ird{-š} is used to form the active root
regardless of the actual thematic consonant. As such we get \ird{parkaš-}
from \irdp{parká}{to park} but \ird{pálč-} from \irdp{palká}{to
punch.} Moreover German loanwords whose infinitives end in \ird{-irná} behave
as if they have a thematic \ird{-r} and so the the active root for
\irdp{télévonirná}{to call (on the phone)} is \ird{télévonirž-}
instead of \ird{*télévonirnaš-}.

The suppletion of the original thematic consonant in the first to third classes
with the class ending causes the preceding vowel to be lengthened in
compensation if the root would have ended in an open syllable or a lateral had
the thematic consonant been removed; thus we have, e.g., \ird{dúš-} from
\irdp{dušá}{to bathe} but \ird{piašč-} and not
\ird{*piášč-} from \irdp{piaštá}{to eat.} If the remnant vowel
is \ird{ě} or the diphthong \ird{ei}, the compensatory lengthening also involves
the reduction of the vowel to \ird{-í} as in \ird{zdíč-} from
\irdp{zděká}{to blow.}

\subsection{Order of inflectional affixes}\label{sec:order-affixes}
\index{affixes}

Verbs are the most complex part of speech in Iridian. A finite verb can take a
maximum of two prefixes and five suffixes, for a total of seven possible `slots'
for affixes in any given verb.\footnote{Practically, however, only four of the
suffix slots can be filled at the same time. This is because an aspect suffix
cannot appear at the same time as the suffix for the verbal mood, (unless if the
verb is in the indicative mood, in which case slot {\sc iii} is null) since the
imperative and hortative are aspectless and the conditional directly encodes
both the mood and the aspect in a single suffix. This point is illustrated in
the maximal example \ird{zánepiaštalnébile} in \ref{fig:verb-structure}} The
order of affixes is illustrated in \ref{fig:verb-structure}. The figure also
shows some examples of increasing complexity.

\section{Voice}\label{sec:voice}
\index{voice}

Iridian often prefers to encode information on the verb instead of through case
marking on nouns. As such, all verbs must be explicitly marked for voice.

\begin{table}
	\sffamily\footnotesize
	\caption{Suffixes used to mark grammatical voice.}\medskip
	\begin{tblr}{width=0.8\textwidth,colspec={XX}}
		\toprule 
		&{\scshape ending}\\ 
		\midrule 
		Agentive	& {-(a)š-}\\ 
		Patientive	& {-in-}\\  
		Benefactive	& {-éb-}\\ 
		Locative	& {-oun-}\\ 
		Instrumental& {-íj-}\\ 
		\bottomrule
	\end{tblr}
\end{table}

\subsection{Agentive voice}\index{agentive voice}

The agentive voice is used if the subject of the verb is the agent of the
action. Unlike English and other languages with a nominative-accusative
morphosyntactic alignment, Iridian does not have a ``default'' voice for a verb.
As such, the unmarked form of a verb is essentially meaningless. Voice must be
explicitly marked on the verb and the agentive does not have any precedence over
the other voices. The agentive voice is marked by the suffix \ird{-aš-}, which
assimilates to the thematic consonant of the verb, as described in
\S\ref{sec:sound-changes}.
\pex
\begingl
\gla Sa piašček.//
\glb already eat-\Av{}-\Pf{}//
\glft `(I) already ate.'//
\endgl
\xe

Where the assimilation involves the deletion of the final consonant in the root,
the preceding vowel is lengthened in compensation if the resulting root would
then end in an open syllable.\index{compensatory lengthening}
\begin{multicols}{2}
\pex
\ird{Udúšek.}\\
(instead of \ird{*udušek})\\
\trsl{(I) took a shower.}
\xe
\pex
\ird{Piašček.}\\
(not \ird{*piášček.})\\
\trsl{(I) ate.}
\xe
\end{multicols}

If the remnant vowel is the i-glide \ird{-ě-} or the diphthongs \ird{-ei-} and
\ird{-ou-}, the remaining vowel would simplify to \ird{í}, \ird{í} and \ird{ú},
respectively. Consider for example the verb \ird{zděká} \trsl{to blow}:

\pex
\begingl
\gla Lest zdičime.//
\glb wind blow-\Av{}-\Prog{}//
\glft \trsl{The wind is blowing.}//
\endgl
\xe

\subsection{Patientive voice}\index{patientive voice}

A verb in the patient focus (glossed \Pv{}) indicates that the topic is the
thematic patient in the sentence. This is roughly equivalent to the English
passive voice, although the patientive voice is more commonly used in Iridian
than the passive voice in English. 

\pex
\begingl
\gla Marek vednik.//
\glb Marek see-\Pv{}-\Pfv{}//
\glft `(I) saw Marek.'//
\endgl
\xe


\subsection{Benefactive voice}\index{benefactive voice}

The benefactive voice (glossed \Ben{}) is used when the subject of the
sentence is the benefactor or director object of the verb. Verbs often change
meaning when used in the benefactive focus.


\begin{multicols}{2}
\pex
\begingl
\gla Mač sega nazdébik.//
\glb mother flower-\Acc{} buy-\Ben{}-\Pf{}//
\glft `(I) bought my mother flowers.'//
\endgl
\xe

\pex
\begingl
\gla Kova piaštébime.//
\glb cow eat-\Ben{}-\Prog{} //
\glft \trsl{(I am) feeding the cows.}//
\endgl
\xe

\end{multicols}

The benefactive is also used idiomatically with verbs of judgment including
\ird{novětá} \trsl{to like}

\pex
\begingl
\gla Dá čehóvám zánovítébime.//
\glb \First\Sg{} sports-\Agt{} \Neg{}-like-\Ben{}-\Prog{}//
\glft \trsl{I don't like sports.}//
\endgl
\xe

\subsection{Locative voice}

The locative voice (glossed \Lv{}) is used when the topic of the sentence is
the location of the action. The locative voice is often used with verbs of
motion, but can also be used, similar to the benefactive voice, idiomatically
with verbs of perception and other verbs, often with a derogatory connotation.

\pex
\begingl
\gla Bištro piaštounime.//
\glb cafeteria eat-\Loc{}-\Prog{}//
\glft \trsl{(We are) eating in the cafeteria.}//
\endgl
\xe

\pex
\begingl
\gla Já kopounime.//
\glb you laugh-\Lv{}-\Prog{}//
\glft \trsl{He is laughing at you.}//
\endgl
\xe

\subsection{Instrumental voice}

The instrumental voice is used when the topic of the sentence is an instrument
of the action. The instrumental voice is still used in Iridian, but is much less
common than the other forms of the verb.

\pex
\begingl
\gla Marcí hrou švirkíjek.//
\glb Marek-\Gen{} pen write-\Iv{}-\Pf{}//
\glft \trsl{I used Marek's pen to write (this).}//
\endgl
\xe


\subsection{Reflexive voice}

The reflexive voice (glossed {\Refl}) is used when the patient of the verb is
also the agent of the action. Morphogically, the reflexive voice is not a
separate voice but is derived from the agentive form of the verb and the
addition of the prefix \ird{u(d)-}.

\pex
\begingl
\gla Na šarta uvižek.//
\glb \Loc{} mirror-Pat{} \Refl{}-see-\Av{}-\Pf{}//
\glft \trsl{I saw myself in the mirror.}//
\endgl
\xe

The use of the reflexive voice is more extensive in Iridian than in
English\index{English}, and is somehow similar to how the reflexive construction
is used in Romance languages.

\pex
\begingl
\gla Uštižek.//
\glb \Refl{}-take:a:bath-\Av{}-\Pf{}//
\glft \trsl{(I) took a bath.}//
\endgl
\xe

\pex
\begingl
\gla Umúšime.//
\glb \Refl{}-comb-\Av{}-\Prog{}//
\glft \trsl{(I) am combing my hair.}//
\endgl
\xe

Below is a non-exhaustive list of verbs that are normally used in the reflexive
voice:
\bigskip

\noindent
\ird{dušá} \trsl{to take a shower}\\
\ird{mušá} \trsl{to comb}\\
\ird{šaštá} \trsl{to sit down}\\

Some verbs may change meaning when used in the reflexive voice.


The reflexive voice is also used to imply that an action happened accidentally
or involuntary or that the agent of the action is unknown or unimportant.

The reflexive voice may also be used emphatically, especially in spoken Iridian,
to express that the action has been performed for the benefit of the actor/agent
of the verb.

\pex
\begingl
\gla Kávéa ušranzącem.//
\glb coffee-\Acc{} \Refl{}-drink-\mk{av-ctplv-1s}//
\glft \trsl{I'll drink coffee.} (literally, I'll drink myself coffee)//
\endgl
\xe

\pex
\begingl
\gla Pulša uvošček.//
\glb soup-\Acc{} \Refl{}-cook-\Av{}-\Pf{}//
\glft \trsl{(I) cooked (me) some soup.}//
\endgl
\xe

\section{Grammatical aspect}\label{sec:aspect}\index{aspect}\index{grammatical
aspect|see{aspect}}

{\scshape grammatical aspect} (or simply {\scshape aspect}) is a category in
Iridian that is used to denote how an action or state described by a verb
extends over time. Aspect contrasts with {\scshape tense} which situates an
action or event as happening or being true at some specific point in time.
Iridian does not mark tense grammatically, as does English\index{English}, for
example, and so the verb in English sentences \trsl{I am watching a movie on TV
now} and \trsl{I was watching a movie on TV when you called} will both be
translated using the same verb in the progressive aspect. 

Aspect also contrasts with {\scshape lexical aspect} or
\foreign{aktionsart}\index{aktionsart@\emph{aktionsart}} in that the latter,
although also describing a verb's structure in relation to time, refers more to
an inherent property of the verb itself and is thus often invariant. Iridian
also does not grammaticalize \foreign{aktionsart}, and thus the distinction
between, say, Polish imperfective \foreign{pisać,} \trsl{to write} and
perfective \foreign{napisać,} \trsl{to write down,} is not one made in the
language (cf. \cite[9--26]{richardson2007}; \cite{comrie1976}).

Iridian formally distinguishes between seven classes of grammatical aspect, five
of which are called {\scshape primary} since they are used to describe the
aspect of an independent main verb while two are called {\scshape secondary}
since they represent a verb's aspect in relation to some other event.

\begin{table}
	\label{tab:aspect}
	\footnotesize\sffamily
	\caption{Aspect markers in the indicative mood.}
	\medskip
	\begin{tblr}{width=0.8\textwidth,colspec={XX[0.5]}}
		\toprule 
		{\sc aspect}	& {\sc affix}\\ 
		\midrule 
		Perfective		& {-ek}\\ 
		Retrospective	& {-aní}\\

		Contemplative	& {-ách/-áh-}\\ 
		Prospective		& {-ujam}\\ 
		Cessative		& {-óvít}\\ 
		\bottomrule
	\end{tblr}
\end{table}


\subsection{Perfective and retrospective
aspect}\label{sec:perfective-retrospective}

Both the perfective aspect (glossed \Pf{}) and the retrospective {glossed
\Ret{}} represent actions that have been completed at some point in time.

The perfective aspect indicates an action that has been completed at some
specific point in time. The thematic ending for the perfective aspect is
\ird{-ek}, but the initial \orth{e} is rather unstable and often changes
depending on the environment. The initial \orth{e} becomes \orth{i} when used
with \ird{-in} (the suffix indicating the patientive voice), with the initial
\orth{i} in the preceding suffix often dropped or replaced by an \orth{e} (e.g.,
\irdp{vedá}{to see} becomes \irdp{vednik}{was seen} and not \ird{*vedinek}).
This change also occurs when following the benefactive suffix \ird{-éb} and when
followed by the quotative suffix \ird{-e}, with the final \ird{-k} in the latter
case fricativized to \orth{c} (e.g., \irdp{piaštá}{to eat} becomes
\irdp{piaštébik}{to be fed} and \irdp{piaščice}{has apparently eaten} and not
\ird{*piaštébek} and \ird{*piaščece}, respectively).

\pex
\begingl
\gla Bych na gnaža Marek vednik.//
\glb yesterday \Loc{} school-\Acc{} Marek see-\Pv{}-\Pf{}//
\glft \trsl{(I) saw Marek at school yesterday.}//
\endgl
\xe

When negated, the perfective indicates something that ought to be done but had
not been done or otherwise to put an emphasis on the non-completion. To state
that something simply did not happen, the negative of the retrospective is used
instead.

\begin{multicols}{2}
\pex
\a\begingl
\gla Zátélévoniržek.//
\glb \Neg{}-telephone-\Av{}-\Pf{}//
\glft `(I) failed to call.' //
\endgl
\a\begingl
\gla Zátélévoniržaní.//
\glb \Neg{}-telephone-\mk{av-ret}//
\glft `(I) didn't call.' //
\endgl
\xe
\end{multicols}

The retrospective aspect is used for a past action that has a continuing
relevance in the presence. Often when using the retrospective aspect, the
emphasis is on the resulting state rather than the event itself. Consider, for
example, the following sentences: (a) \trsl{I went to Amsterdam last week}; and
(b) \trsl{I have been to Berlin in my childhood}. Iridian would translate the
verb in (a) using the perfective and the verb in (b) using the retrospective.
The retrospective may also be called the {\scshape perfect} in other sources but
we shall be solely referring to it as the former in this grammar to avoid any
confusion. In addition, the retrospective in Iridian always has a perfective
interpretation, i.e., a sentence like \trsl{I have been waiting here an hour}
which has a verb in the perfect is translate using the progressive instead of
the retrospective.

\pex
\begingl
\gla Hrona hletu na Budapešta možlašime.//
\glb three year-\Ins{} \Loc{} Budapest-\Acc{} live-\mk{av-prog}//
\glft `I have been living in Budapest for three years.'//
\endgl
\xe

\pex
\begingl
\gla Vegetarevní gulášý stavíčaní, ma toleto záčeščik.//
\glb vegetarian goulash-\Gen{} eat:a:bit-\Av{}-\Ret{} but \Aff{} \Neg{}-like-\Av{}-\Pf{}-\Quot{}//
\glft \trsl{I have tried vegetarian goulash before but I didn't like it at all.} //
\endgl
\xe

The retrospective is also used to describe an event that is expected or planned
to happen before a certain point in the future.

\pex
\begingl
\gla Dá ščenžit še Marek uzdravžaní.//
\glb \First{}\Sg{}.\Str{} arrive-\Av{}-\SupP{} \Com{} Marek \Refl{}-sleep-\Av{}-\Ret{}//
\glft \trsl{Marek would already have been asleep by the time I arrived.} //
\endgl
\xe

\pex
\begingl
\gla Na armašta ščenžice dnóvim po zázdalšaní.//
\glb \Loc{} airport-\Acc{} arrive-\Av{}-\SupP{}-\Att{} front-\Ins{} yet have:breakfast-\Av{}-\Ret{}//
\glft \trsl{We will not have eaten breakfast before we get to the airport tomorrow.} //
\endgl
\xe

Moreover, the retrospective is often used to imply non-volition or the
accidental/circumstantial nature of an action. Similarly the retrospective is
used with verbs of emotion or state (e.g., \irdp{zuštalá}{to become happy} from
\irdp{zuštalé}{happy}. The perfective, on the other hand, is almost exclusively
used with the causative in these cases.

\pex
\a	\begingl
\gla Jí véžik še zuštalšaní.//
\glb \Second{}\Sg{}.\Acc{} see-\Av{}-\Pf{} \Com{} be.happy-\Av{}-\Ret{}//
\glft `I became happy when I saw you.' //
\endgl
\a	\begingl
\gla Jám nezuštalnik.//
\glb \Second{}\Sg{}.\Agt{} \Caus{}-be.happy-\Pv{}-\Pf{}//
\glft `You made (me) happy.' //
\endgl
\xe
\pex<vasebroke>
\begingl
\gla Váz uprížaní.//
\glb vase \Refl{}-break-\Av{}-\Pf{}//
\glft `The vase broke (accidentally).' //
\endgl
\xe

\subsection{Continuous and progressive aspects}
Iridian uses the continuous and progressive aspects to denote actions that have
not been completed yet and/or are in the process of happening/occuring. The
continuous aspect (glossed \Cont{}) is used to mark a state of being while the
progressive aspect (glossed \Prog{}) is used to mark a dynamic activity.
\pex
\begingl
\gla Nau urištneví.//
\glb clothes \Refl{}-wear-\Pv{}-\Cont{}//
\glft \trsl{(I'm) wearing clothes.} //
\endgl
\xe

\pex
\begingl
\gla Nau urištnime.//
\glb clothes \Refl{}-wear-\Pv{}-\Prog{}//
\glft \trsl{(I'm) putting on clothes.} //
\endgl
\xe

The continuous aspect is also used to denote a habitual action.

\pex
\begingl
\gla Sholu de gnaža stoževí.//
\glb daily-\Ins{} \mk{ill} school-\Acc{} go-\Av{}-\Cont{}//
\glft \trsl{(We) go to school everyday.} //
\endgl
\xe

\pex
\begingl
\gla Dá na Praha možleví.//
\glb \First{}\Sg{} \Loc{} Prague-\Acc{} live-\Cont{}//
\glft \trsl{I live in Prague.} //
\endgl
\xe

To emphasize the habitual nature of an action, a nominalized construction is
often used.

\pex
\begingl
\gla Nažem rącenživou.//
\glb friend-\First{}\Sg{} smoke-\mk{av-cont-nz}//
\glft \trsl{My friend is a smoker.} //
\endgl
\xe

\subsection{Contemplative aspect}

The contemplative aspect (glossed \Ctp{}) is used to mark an action that has not
started yet. If the emphasis, however, is on the speaker's intention to do
something, and not on the incompleteness or futurity of the action itself, the
supine of purpose is used instead of the contemplative. The same is true for
events which the speaker thinks is improbable or unlikely to happen but whose
non-occurence they are nonetheless unsure of.

\subsection{Prospective and cessative aspects}

The prospective aspect (glossed \Prosp{}) is primarily used in secondary clauses
to indicate actions that are about to be started in relation to another action.
The prospective is also used to indicate an action that has been interrupted by
another action without having been started yet. It can also be used in the main
clause to indicate an action in the immediate future, The cessative aspect
(glossed \Ces{}) on the other hand is used to indicate an action that has been
recently completed. The cessative is often used with the particle
\irdp{prě}{only}.

\section{Valency and control}
\index{valency}\index{valence|see{valency}}\index{control}

{\scshape valency} (or {\scshape valence})\index{valency} is the number of overt
arguments a verb\index{argument of a verb} can take in a sentence.
\textcite[239]{tesniere1965}, in one of the earliest description of the concept,
likens valency by comparing it to bonds between atoms:
\begin{quotation}
	\small
The verb may therefore be compared to a sort of atom, susceptible to attracting
a greater or lesser number of actants,\footnote{In his work Tesnière used the
term \emph{actants} to refer to what we would call here the verb's
\trsl{arguments.}} according to the number of bonds the verb has available to
keep them as dependents. The number of bonds a verb has constitutes what we call
the verb's valency.
\end{quotation}

More rigorous treatments\footnote{\posscite{tesniere1959} definition of valency
as \trsl{nombre d'\emph{actants} qu'un verbe est susceptible de régir}
(\trsl{number of \emph{actants} which a verb is capable of governing})
essentially frames valency as a function of the verb. More recent definitions
however consider valency not just as a property of verbs alone but of any
lexical item (cf., e.g., \cite{matthews1997,trask1993}). In addition, in his
glossary, he has provided voice (Fr. \emph{voix}) as a synonym for valency;
these two terms however we consider as distinct items both in this work and in
what I think is the usage of both terms in scholarly literature over the topic.}
have of course been published in the years since but we should content ourselves
with this definition in our present treatment of Iridian grammar. Instead our
primary focus would e

\subsection{Avalent verbs}

Avalent verbs \index{avalent verb} are verbs that have zero core arguments. In
Iridian they are limited to a small set of verbs that describe meteorological
phenomena, traditionally referred to as `weather verbs' (\ird{plodní sládek})
\index{weather verb}.This term is not wholly accurate, however, as the class
includes not just meteorological phenomena but more general natural phenomena as
well. When used this way they are marked in the agentive voice\index{agentive
voice} and essentially forms topicless sentences\index{topicless sentence}
(cf.~\S\,\ref{sec:topicless}). Some common weather verbs in Iridian are listed
below.

\irdp{žužá}{to snow}\\
\irdp{pozbá}{to rain}\\
\irdp{néšá}{to rain lightly, to drizzle}\\
\irdp{boboržá}{to have thunder}\\
\irdp{kopriká}{to have lightning}\\
\irdp{dozbuhá}{to have an earthquake}
\xe

\subsection{Causative constructions}\index{causative}

Causatives may either be lexical, analytical or morphological. Lexical
causatives involve the encoding of the causation on the verb itself leading the
causative form of the verb to be a different form altogether. An analytical
causative, on the other hand uses a different verb (usually a verb like \emph{to
do} or \emph{to make}) in conjunction with the main verb, to express the idea of
causation (e.g., English\index{English} \trsl{make someone do something.})
Finally, morphological causatives involve morphologically changing the main verb
to express the notion of causation. Iridian causative constructions are
primarily morphological, formed using the prefix \ird{ne-}.

    \end{tblr}
\end{table}

Due to this suppletive nature, lexical causatives imply a more direct causation,
or a tighter link between cause and event\footnote{\textcite{haiman1983} offers
a thorough discussion of how the linguistic distance exhibited by the forms of
causative constructions existing in a language (e.g., \emph{to cause to die} on
one end of the spectrum versus \emph{to kill} on the other) correspond to the
conceptual distance between the action of the causer and the result of the
action to the causee. In a purely synthetic construction like \emph{kill}, for
example, where the linguistic distance is the least, the conceptual distance
between the action and the resulting state is also the smallest, with the
opposite being true in purely analytical constructions like \emph{to cause to
die}.}, than analytical or morphological causatives (\cite{velupillai2012,
haiman1983}). Consider for example the three sentences in English\index{English}
below:


\pex
\a Joseph \emph{died}.\deftagex{caus}
\a Joseph \emph{killed} the man.\deftagex{caus}\deftaglabel{kill}
\a Joseph \emph{made} the man \emph{die.}\deftagex{caus}\deftaglabel{made}
\xe

The suppletive \emph{kill} in example (\getfullref{caus.kill}) implies more
agency on the part of the subject than the more indirect-sounding
(\getfullref{caus.made}). In (\getfullref{caus.kill}) the \emph{death} of the
patient (\trsl{the man}) is the goal of the act while (\getfullref{caus.made})
it might be inferred that the \emph{dying} was an indirect consequence of an
unmentioned second act.


Iridian does not employ lexical causatives as in English\index{English}; instead
causatives are formed morphologically by adding the prefix \ird{ne-} (glossed as
\Caus{}) to the verb stem. Although \ird{ne-} is required to form the causative
morphologically, some verbs, particularly stative verbs like \irdp{shradá}{to
die, to be dead} in table \ref{tbl:causative} may already contain the notion of
causation in some of its regular conjugated forms. This is because by default
stative verbs\index{stative verb} are intransitive (i.e., the only argument
required is the actor/agent\index{agent}) while some verbal voices\index{voice}
like the patientive\index{patientive voice} and benefactive\index{benefactive
voice} inherently imply the existence of a second and a third argument of a
verb\index{argument of a verb} respectively.

%% TODO add section reference

Of course Iridian's definition of which verbs are stative and which ones are
dynamic\index{dynamic verb} does not neatly align with the definition those
classes have in English\index{English} (v. \S\,\ref{sec:statives}). For instance
the verbs \emph{to stand} and \emph{to eat} are both dynamic verbs in
English\index{English}, while in Iridian \irdp{zdavá}{to stand, to be standing}
is stative and only \irdp{piaštá}{to eat} is dynamic. This is why as we see in
example (\getfullref{statdyn.1}) below, some forms of the verb \ird{zdavá}
already contain the notion of causation in some of its regular conjugated forms.

\pex
\a  \irdp{zdavá}{to be standing}\deftagex{statdyn}\deftaglabel{1}\\
	\irdp{zdavžá}{to stand}\\
    \irdp{zdavná}{to be made standing, to erect}\\
    \irdp{nezdavžá}{to make so./sth. stand}\\
    \irdp{nezdavná}{to be made to make so./sth. standing}
\a  \irdp{piaštá}{to eat}\\
    \irdp{piaštiná}{to be eaten}\\
    \irdp{nepiaščá}{to make someone eat}
\xe

Since causative constructions in Iridian are purely morphological\footnote{To
contrast, consider Japanese\index{Japanese} which also forms causative
constructions morphologically (using the suffix \emph{-(sa)se}) but which in
addition also has synthetic but not fully suppletive forms for some verbs (e.g.,
\irdp{agaru}{to rise} and \irdp{ageru}{to raise}).} the degree of agency of the
causer can be implied from other incidental properties of the verb such as
aspect or voice markings.

We pay particular attention first on the interaction of the causative prefix
\ird{ne-} with the patientive voice marker \ird{-in} and the benefactive voice
marker \ird{-éb}. We begin with stative verbs, since as mentioned earlier and in
\S\,XX, most stative verbs will have a causative reading when used with the
agentive or benefactive voice. Stative verbs encode the state of the subject and
cannot therefore express the idea of an agent nor that of a patient. By
conjugating stative verbs for voice, their stative nature is therefore lost;
that is why a causative cannot be derived from the unmarked form of a stative
verb: a causative construction precludes the existence of a causer and a causee,
which at times may be different from the subject, while the unmarked stative
only that of the subject itself.

  \label{causative-reading}
\end{figure}

We see in figure \ref{causative-reading} that this causative reading of the
patientive voice with stative verbs is due to properties of stative verbs and
not of the patientive voice. We know this is true since this causative reading
of the patientive does not exist with non-stative verbs, which are transitive by
default in Iridian.

    \gla Mámka zuštalnik.//
    \glb mother happy-\Pv{}-\Pf{}//
    \glft \trsl{I made my mother happy.}//
\endgl
\xe

The patientive voice only requires a patient as argument; however since this
argument does not exist in stative constructions, the role of an agent must
first be created for the subject of the stative construction to be able to
occupy the role of the patient in the patientive voice. Essentially this means
that conjugating a stative verb for the patientive voice is equivalent to
creating a biclausal causative construction where the subject becomes the causee
and the state the action brought about by the (optionally named) causer. This
reading is not possible with dynamic verbs because the patientive voice would
only shift the role of the patient to that of the topic without having to create
a new role for an agent.

As could have been predicted from \posscite{haiman1983} theory, these indirect
forms of the causative express a more direct link between the causer and the
action. True morphological causatives, i.e., those formed using the prefix
\ird{ne-}, imply that the caused action was brought about by an intermediary.

\begin{multicols}{2}
\pex

\gla Váz nepriznek.//
\glb vase \Caus{}-break-\Pv{}-\Pf{}//
\glft \trsl{I made someone break the vase.}//
\endgl
\xe
\end{multicols}

If the intermediary appears in the sentence it can be marked either in the
genitive or in the patientive. Marking the causee in the genitive is the
\trsl{neutral} configuration; using the patientive case on the other hand forms
what can be called a \emph{coercive} causative
(\cite{shibatani1990,lehmann2006}), which in Iridian\footnote{We can compare
this to a similar distinction between a dative causative (formed with the clitic
\emph{ni}) and the accusative causative (formed with \emph{o}) in
Japanese\index{Japanese}. \textcite{lehmann2006} calls the former a coercive
causative construction while the latter a permissive causative construction.
There are two main differences between the Japanese\index{Japanese} and Iridian
systems however. First the coercive causative in Iridian also implies that the
agent has effective control over the action or the causee or both, something not
necessarily expressed by the Japanese\index{Japanese} \emph{o}-form; and second,
both the patientive and the genitive forms of the causative in Iridian allow
`permissive' readings, as we illustrate later in this section.

More importantly however the genitive form is considered the default or neutral
form in Iridian, with the patientive form considered as more `marked.' The
patientive is often used for emphasis, with the genitive construction replacing
it where possible, especially in spoken Iridian, even in places where the use of
the patientve would have been in better order. } could imply either of two
things: (i) that the act was made without or against the consent of the causee
or (ii) the causer had direct control over the action and/or the causee. Such
distinction however is not possible if the main verb is in the agentive voice
since the patientive marking is reserved for the patient of the verb (and thus
marking the causee in the patientive will essentially produce a situation where
both the agent and the patient of the verb is marked for the same role, which in
this case is the patient.)

\pex

\glb vase Janek-\Acc{} \Caus{}-break-\Pv{}-\Pf{}//
\glft \trsl{(I) made John break the vase.}//
\endgl
\xe


Nevertheless the degree of control exerted by the causer over the action itself
may vary between these constructions.

A common way to formally mark the causer's control or lack thereof in Iridian is
the opposition between the retrospective aspect and the perfective aspect.
Consider for example the two sentences in Iridian below, both of which have the
same general translation in English\index{English}.

\pex

We discuss control and volition in more detail in \ref{sec:non-volitive}.

\subsection{Reflexive, reciprocal, and sociative constructions}\index{reflexive
construction}\index{reflexive voice}\index{reciprocal construction}

The reciprocative prefix \ird{so-} (glossed \Rec{}) is used with the agentive
voice to indicate that an action is performed by the agent and the patient on
each other.

\pex
\begingl
\gla Karlu sodalšime še Marek ščenžek.//
\glb Karel-\Ins{} \Rec{}-talk-\mk{av-prog} with Marek arrive-\Av{}-\Pf{}//
\glft \trsl{Karel (and I) were talking when Marek arrived.}//
\endgl
\xe

The use of the reciprocative inherently implies plurality on the part of the
subject since there are always at least two elements involved (cf.
\cite[255]{tesniere1965}). Since Iridian does not often grammaticalize
plurality\index{plural}, this means the reciprocative usually won't require
additional consideration as to the agreement of the constituents of the
sentence; it does, however, mean that this form cannot be used singly with the
singular form of pronouns (since pronouns---at least in the first and second
persons---formally distinguish between singular and plural) and that most
countable nouns would require the use of the particle \ird{ně} or an explicit
quantifier.

\pex
\begingl
\gla Na to hruma hurka sokonížek.//

\glft \trsl{(I) saw the senators shouting at each other on TV.}//
\endgl
\xe

Where both elements of the agent-patient pair are present in the sentence, one
of them is treated as the agent and left unmarked while the other is marked in
the comitative\index{comitative} (i.e., \ird{še} + instrumental). However, since
the action itself is reciprocal, which gets marked as the agent is purely a
pragmatic choice. Where one of the members of the agent-patient pair is a
pronoun, preference is given to marking the pronoun as the agent (in which case
\ird{še} is normally ommitted, but with the patient remaining in the
instrumental case).

\endgl
\xe

Sociative verbs\index{sociative verb}, on the other hand, which are formed with
the prefix \ird{se-} (and glossed here as \Soc{}), indicate actions that are
performed with another person or other people. These may also represent joining
or participating in actions that have been started by somebody. The prefix
\ird{se-} is realized as \ird{s-} except before sibilants and the approximant
/j/. Sociative verbs are formed with the locative voice, with the noun phrase in
the topic representing the person/people with whom an action is done. Note that
sociative verb constructions cannot be used with inanimate/non-human noun
phrases.

\subsection{Non-volitive constructions}
\label{sec:non-volitive}

In linguistics, {\sc volition} is a grammatical category that expresses whether
or not the actor exercised control over the action described by the verb, i.e.,
whether or not the action, as it happened, was intended. In general, an unmarked
verb will be interpreted as volitive. Non-volition must be expressed explicitly
with the prefix \ird{od} which takes the same verbal slot as the causative
\ird{ne-}.

\pex
\begingl
	\gla Vaz z mězí oduktoužek a oduprižek.//
	\glb vase from table=\Gen{} \N{}\Vol{}-\Refl{}-fall-\Av{}-\Pf{} \N{}\Vol{}-\Refl{}-break-\Av{}-\Pf{}//
	\glft \trsl{The vase fell off the table and broke.}//
\endgl
\xe

Sensory verbs are interpreted as non-volitive by default and do not need to be
marked with \ird{od-}. Instead, it is volition that must be marked explicitly
with the prefix \ird{pě-}. Before verbs with a vowel onset, \ird{} is realized
as /pʲě/. \ird{P} however is not fully productive and cannot be used with
non-sensory verbs; some sensory verbs may allow neither \ird{od-} nor \ird{pě-}.

\section{Grammatical mood}\label{sec:mood}
\index{mood}\index{grammatical mood|see{mood}}

{\sc grammatical mood} is a grammatical category that expresses the attitude of
the speaker or writer with respect to the proposition expressed by the verb. In
Iridian, there are four grammatical moods: indicative\index{indicative mood},
imperative\index{imperative mood}, hortative\index{hortative mood}, and
conditional\index{conditional mood}. Thus far, we have only discussed the
indicative mood, which is the `default' verbal mood in most statements, as this
mood is used to express propositions that are true. The other three moods are
used to express propositions that are not necessarily true, but rather express
the speaker's attitude towards the proposition. The imperative mood is used to
express commands and prohibitions, the hortative mood is used to express
requests and wishes, and the conditional mood is used to express propositions
that are false, or whose truth is unknown or uncertain or dependent on some
other condition. In this section, we will discuss the other three moods in more
detail.


\subsection{Imperative and hortative mood}\label{sec:imp-hort}
\index{imperative}\index{hortative}

To form commands\index{commands} and requests\index{requests}, the imperative
(glossed \Imp{}) and hortative (\mk{hort}) moods are used in Iridian.

The imperative is formed by replacing the infinitive ending \ird{-á} with the
voice marker and the imperative ending \ird{-ím}. Since the
imperative\index{imperative mood} cannot be negated with the prefix \ird{zá-},
a separate negative imperative ending \ird{-í} is used to form negative
commands/prohibitions.

         {dopiaštouní}\\ 

         \bottomrule
    \end{tblr}

\end{table}

Verbs in the imperative mood do not require an explicit referent, with the
addressee or addressees assumed to be the recipient of the command or
prohibition. Note that both forms of the imperative do not distinguish number;
thus the same form of the verb will be used when giving a command to multiple
addressees and to a single one.

    \glft \trsl{Do not write (anything) on this sheet of paper.}//
\endgl
\xe

Due to its directness, the use of the imperative or the prohibitive is
considered impolite in most settings, and is often used only when speaking with
friends, family or children. This distinction does not exist in the written
language, where the imperative is used almost exclusively for these functions.

In spoken Iridian, it is more common and considered more polite to use the
hortative instead of the direct imperative. The hortative is formed by replacing
the infinitive ending \ird{-á} with the voice marker and the hortative ending
\ird{-é} or the negative hortative ending \ird{-o}. The ending \ird{-o} surfaces
as \ird{-u} after the locative and instrumental voice markers.

\xe

To further soften command, the expression \ird{am luhkné} (from the hortative
form of the verb \irdp{luhká}{to thank} and the defective particle \ird{am}
which used to mean \trsl{because}), \ird{am luhkno} can be used, with the main
verb marked as a perfective converb.\index{converb}\footnote{Cf. the use of the
perfective converb with the \textit{merci de} + infinitive construction in
French\index{French}. The use of \ird{am luhkné} presupposes that the action
being requested has already been done although in fact it hasn't, for which
therefore the speaker is giving thanks. Thus, a simple request like \trsl{Please
close the door} is expressed in Iridian as \trsl{May you be thanked for having
closed the door.}}

\pex
\begingl
\gla Miní návilastu am luhkné.//
\glb door-\Gen{} open-\Cv{}.\Pf{} because thank-\Pv{}-\Hort{}//
\glft \trsl{Please open the door.}//
\endgl
\xe

The adhortative (\trsl{Let's}) is formed using \ird{lidovká} with the
imperfective converb form of the main verb. \ird{Lidovká} can also be used by
itself where the main verb may be implied from context, or as a reply to the
request if the speaker wants to express agreement or assent.

\pex
\begingl
\gla Piaštiec lidovká.//
\glb eat-\Cv{}.\Ipf{} because thank-\Pv{}-\Hort{}//
\glft \trsl{Please open the door.}//
\endgl
\xe

Alternatively, the verb stem\index{verb stem} without the infinitive marker
\ird{-á} can be used to form can be used to issue commands. When issuing
commands this way, the verb can only take an agentive meaning. This form is used
when issuing one-word commands, such as \irdp{Piašt!}{Eat!} or
\irdp{Hrab!}{Listen!}.\footnote{An epenthetic \ird{e} is inserted when the verb
stem ends in an otherwise unpronouncable (or at least very difficult to
pronounce) consonant cluster, e.g., \irdp{Švirek!}{Write!} instead of
\irdp{Švirk!}{Write!}.} In writing, this would often be written with an
exclamation mark.

When use this way, only the verb stem can appear in the sentence without any
other arguments, with very few exceptions, listed as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The verb may be used with the accusative pronouns \irdp{jí}{you (acc.
	sing.)}, \irdp{tě}{you (acc. sing.)}, \irdp{mě}{us}. The resulting sentence
	has exactly the same meaning as it would have otherwise had even without the
	pronoun, but it may be use to further specify the addressee. With \ird{mě},
	this usage overlaps with the hortative \trsl{Let's}; e.g., \irdp{Mě
	piašt!}{Let's eat!}.
	\item The verb may be used with the demonstratives \irdp{tak}{here},
	\irdp{jení}{there (near the speaker)} and \irdp{dně}{over there}: e.g.,
	\irdp{Tak piašt!}{Eat here!}.
	\item The verb may be used with a combination of the above two exceptions,
	with the demonstrative appearing before the pronoun: e.g., \irdp{Jení mě
	piašt!}{Let's eat there!}.
\end{enumerate}

Using the verb stem to issue commands sits in the middle ground between the
formality of the hortative and the directness of the imperative. The form with
\ird{mě}, especially, would often be used to communicate friendliness or
intimacy, when used instead of the hortative. However, since this usage by
default takes only an agentive a choice of either of the latter two may be
required, especially in longer, more complex commands. Due to its brevity,
however, this form would often be used in signages and other similar written
materials.

\subsection{Conditional mood}\label{sec:conditional}\index{conditional mood}

The conditional mood is used in statements which are not true or verifiably
true, or whose truth is unknown or is dependent on another condition. The use of
the conditional mood include wishes, judgments, or opinions, among others. This
form is also called the `conjunctive' in other grammars, after the name in
Iridian \ird{(konjunktivné htě)} which itself borrows from the German
\foreign{Konjunktiv}. There are two forms of the conditional, the imperfective
and the perfective, distinguished by whether or not the purported action has
been completed. These are formed by the suffixes \ird{-y} and \ird{-il}
respectively. Table \ref{tbl:conditional} shows the forms of the conditional
mood.

\begin{table}
    \footnotesize\sffamily
		\caption{Conjugation of the verb \irdp{piaštá}{to eat} in the conditional mood.}

		 {dopiaštounil} \\
		
         \bottomrule
    \end{tblr}

\end{table}

A verb in the conditional mood cannot be used as a main verb in a sentence. The
use of the conditional mood falls into two main categories: conditional
sentences (discussed in \S\,\ref{sec:conditional-sentences}) and subordination
(discussed in \S\,\ref{sec:conditional-subordination}).


The conditional mood is also used in subordinate clauses that are predicated by
verbs expressing wishes, desires, hopes, commands, etc. We will classify constructions that use the conditional in the subordinate clause into the following groups, according to the nature of the subordinate clause:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item purpose clauses
	\item causal clauses
	\item concessive clauses
	\item result clauses
	\item indirect commands and indirect question
\end{enumerate}

The conditional mood is also used in `purpose clauses',

Indirect commands are formed identically as purpose clauses. However, the main
verb must be further marked in the quotative to indicate that the speaker is not
directly commanding the addressee to do the action described in the subordinate
or that the command is not coming directly from the speaker. Unlike regular
quoted clauses, an indirect command would be terminated by \ird{by} rather than
the regular quotative marker \ird{cy}.

\pex
	\begingl
		\gla Marek kaznášejí by Janek dalšek.//
		\glb Marek sing-\Av{}-\Cond{}.\Ipf{}-\Quot{} \Rel{} Janek say-\Av{}-\Pf{}.//
		\glft \trsl{Janek told Marek to sing.}//
	\endgl
\xe

Indirect questions follow the same pattern as indirect commands. They are used
when quoting or embedding a direct question or when the speaker wants to ask the
addressee a question indirectly. A direct question is terminated by
\irdp{teby}{whether} rather than the regular quotative marker \ird{cy} or
\ird{by}.

\pex
	\begingl
		\gla Jena kolča odkonalounile teby po važime.//
		\glb where key-\Acc{} \N{}\Vol{}-leave-\Lv{}-\Cond{}.\Pf{}-\Quot{} whether still think-\Av{}-\Prog{}//
		\glft \trsl{I am still wondering where I left my keys.}//

	\endgl

quotative in general, see \S\,\ref{sec:quotative} and
\S\,\ref{sec:reportedspeech}.

\section{Evidentiality}\label{sec:quotative}\index{quotative}\index{evidentiality}

Iridian marks {\scshape evidentiality} as a separate grammatical category,
distinguishing between a marked {\scshape quotative} or {\scshape reportative}
representing secondhand information or hearsay (or more idiomatically when the
speaker wishes distance themself from the statement by saying that the
information is not coming directly from them) and an unmarked form representing
`everything else' (cf. \cite[31-33]{aikhenvald2004}). The quotative form of a
finite verb (and of some non-finite verb forms) is seen in Table
\ref{tbl:quotative}. The syntax of quotative constructions is discussed in
detail in \S\,\ref{sec:quotative-const}.

\section{Modality}\index{modality}\label{sec:modality}

Iridian can express modality either through verbal morphology, using the affixes
listed in table \ref{tbl:modality}, or through a periphrastic construction. In
general a periphrastic construction is preferred when the verb is non-dynamic,
i.e., the sentence is merely descriptive or stative in nature (compare, for
example English\index{English} \trsl{Mary can sing} vs. \trsl{Mary was able to
finish baking the cake}), while the morphological method is used otherwise.

\begin{table}
    \footnotesize\sffamily
    \caption{Verbal affixes to express modality.}
    \medskip
    \label{tbl:modality}
	\begin{tblr}{width=0.5\textwidth,colspec={X[1.4]X}}
			\toprule 
			{\sc modality} & {\sc affix} \\

				Desiderative\index{desiderative modality} & -évn- \\ 
				Debitive\index{debitive modality} & -ušh- \\ 
			\bottomrule
    \end{tblr}
\end{table}

As in most languages, modal constructions in Iridian exhibit significant
{\scshape polysemy}\index{polysemy} (i.e. a single construction can have one or
more interpretation depending on the context). For example consider the
following sentence:

\pex
\begingl
\gla Tomáš rušku zahviržalnách.//
\glb Tomáš Russian-\Ins{} speak-\Av{}-\Pot{}-\Ctp{}//
\glft \trsl{Tomáš will be able to speak Russian}//
\endgl
\xe

The following translations are all equally possible without any further
contextual clues:

\pex
\a \trsl{Tomáš will be able to speak Russian, if he will study it.} (abilitative)
\a \trsl{Tomáš will be able to speak Russian because he will be allowed to do it.} (permissive)
\a \trsl{Tomáš can speak Russian and he will probably speak it later.} (true potential modality)
\xe


\subsection{Potential modality}\label{sec:potential}
\index{potential modality}\index{abilitative}\index{permissive}\index{modality}

The potential modality (glossed as \Pot{}) is used when, in the speaker's
opinion, an event is possible to occur. This definition makes the potential mood
in Iridian encompass both the expressions of ability and permissibility.

\pex
\begingl
\gla To švirek moc gruševí še zoštnalneví.//
\glb this handwriting too be:small-\Cont{} with \Neg{}-read-\Pv{}-\Pot{}-\Cont{}//
\glft \trsl{The handwriting is too small (I) am unable to read it.}//
\endgl
\xe

\subsection{Debitive modality}\label{sec:debitive}
\index{debitive modality}\index{modality}

The debitive form of a verb expresses necessity or obligation. This verb form is
now mainly confined in literary usage, and has been entirely replaced in
colloquial Iridian by the supine of necessity.\index{supine} The negated form of
the debitive has survived and coexists with the negated form of the supine of
necessity, with subtle differences in meaning. The below examples illustrate
these differences. The negative form of the supine of necessity is used to
indicate that there is no obligation or need to perform the action, while the
negative debitive form is used to indicate that there is an obligation or need
to refrain from performing the action.

\begin{multicols}{2}

  \endgl
  \xe
\end{multicols}

\subsection{Desiderative modality}\label{sec:desiderative}

The desiderative modality is used when the speaker wants something to happen.




\section{Non-finite verb forms}

\subsection{Infinitive}\label{sec:infinitive}\index{infinitive}

The {\scshape infinitive} is a fossilized verb form that was used in Old
Iridian\index{Old Iridian} (and arguably in Early Middle Iridian\index{Middle
Iridian}) as a verbal noun occupying the topic\index{topic} position in a
sentence. In Modern Iridian this use has been completely supplanted by the
gerund\index{gerund} and the infinitive is only used as the citation
form\index{citation form} of verbs. All infinitives in Iridian end in the vowel
\ird{-á} and the consonant immediately preceding it is called the verb's
thematic consonant.\index{thematic consonant}.

\subsection{Nominalized forms and gerunds}\label{sec:nominalized}
\index{gerund}\index{nominalization}

Nouns can be routinely derived from verbs and verb phrases using the
nominalizing suffix \ird{-ou} (glossed as \Nz{}). Linguists generally recognize
three types of nominalization: event nominals, which describe an event the same
way the parent verb does, and which could either be (1) simple or (2) complex,
with {\scshape complex event nominals} ({\sc cen}s)\index{nominalization!event
nominal}\index{event nominal|see{nominalization, event nominal}} allowing
internal arguments and {\scshape simple event nominals} ({\sc
sen}s)\index{nominalization!event nominal} not; and (3) {\scshape resultant
nominals}\index{nominalization!resultant nominal}\index{resultant
nominal|see{nominalization, resultant nominal}}, which describe an event similar
but not exactly corresponding to the even described by the main verb
(\cite{grimshaw1990}; \cite{moulton2014}). In English\index{English}, for
example, where verbs can be nominalized using a variety of derivational affixes
or with zero derivation, these types are not distinguished, as we see below:

\pex[interpartskip=0pt]
	\a The examination of the students lasted a long time. \hfill {\sc cen}
	\a The examination lasted a long time.\hfill {\sc sen}
	\a The examination was photocopied on green paper.\hfill {\sc rn}\\
	\trailingcitation{(\cite[2]{alexiadou2008})}
\xe

Some verbs in Iridian allow the formation of {\sc rn}s using the suffix
\ird{-ou} and the uninflected verb root (e.g., \irdp{piaštou}{food} from
\irdp{piaštá}{to eat}). For the vast majority, however, {\sc rn}s are produced
by lexical suppletion, i.e., the {\sc rn}s are not morphologically derived (or
explicitly so, at least) using the nominalizing suffix (see
\S~\ref{sec:nomder-verb}). As in English, {\sc sen}s and {\sc cen}s are not
morphologically distinct in Iridian, and are formed with the suffix \ird{-ou}
and the gerund-forming suffix \ird{-c}.

\pex
\a Nominalized forms of \irdp{piaštou}{to eat} showing a productive
morphological {\sc rn}:\smallskip\\
		\vtop{\halign{%
			#\hfil& \qquad #\hfil\cr
			\quad Infinitive: 				& \irdp{piaštá}{to eat}\cr
			\quad Morphological {\sc rn}:	& \irdp{piaštou}{food}\cr
			\quad Gerund ({\sc sen/cen}):	& \irdp{piaštouc}{the act of eating}\cr
		}}

\a Nominalized forms of \irdp{vadá}{to think} showing a defective morphological
{\sc rn} and the alternative lexical {\sc rn}:\smallskip\\
	\vtop{\halign{%
		#\hfil& \qquad #\hfil\cr

			\quad Morphological {\sc rn}:	& \ird{*vadou} (ungrammatical)\cr
			\quad Lexical {\sc rn}:			& \irdp{věd}{thought (n.)}\cr
			\quad Gerund ({\sc sen/cen}):	& \irdp{vadouc}{the act of thinking}\cr
	}}
\xe

Event nominals are inherently abstract in meaning. They denote an action, a
state, or a characteristic. The formation of gerunds\index{gerund} is completely
productive, and is the preferred way in Iridian for deriving abstract nouns from
verbs.

\pex    
		\irdp{kopá}{to laugh} → \irdp{kopouc}{laughter}\\
		\irdp{zuštalá}{to be happy} → \irdp{zuštalouc}{happiness}\\
        \irdp{shradá}{to die, be dead} → \irdp{shradouc}{death}\\
        \irdp{vošká}{to cook} → \irdp{voškouc}{cooking}\\
        \irdp{všihná}{to be angry} → \irdp{všihnouc}{anger}\\
        \irdp{zahraná}{to begin} → \irdp{zahranouc}{beginning}\\
\xe

Gerunds are not conjugated for voice or aspect. They can, however, be negated by
the prefix \ird{zá-} as in regular verbs. In addition, the suffix \ird{-év}
(derived from the continuous aspect marker \ird{-eví}) may also be used to
indicate that the act or state described by the gerund is repetitive in nature.

\pex    \irdp{zánidouc}{the act of not standing up}\\
        \irdp{nidévouc}{the act of standing up again and again}
\xe

In addition to these three types of nominalization introduced in
\textcite{grimshaw1990}, Iridian recognizes a fourth type, which produces a
nominal that refers not to the event itself but one of the event's participants,
i.e., one of the verbs arguments. We will call this type a {\scshape participant
nominal} ({\sc pn}) (cf. \cite[400-5]{schackow2015}; \cite[297-8]{okuna}).
Participant nominals are obligatorily marked for voice and optionally for
aspect. An aspectless participant nominal would generally be indefinite in
meaning.

\pex	\irdp{piaštnou}{a thing that is eaten (in general)}\\
		\irdp{piaštnikou}{the thing that was eaten}\\
		\irdp{piaštnáchou}{the thing that will be eaten}
\xe

The syntax of event and participant nominals is discussed in further detail in
\S~\ref{sec:nomz-syntax}.

\subsection{Converbs}\index{converb}\label{sec:converb}

Converbs (glossed \Cv{}) are a non-finite verb form often used for adverbial
constructions. There are two converb forms in Iridian: the imperfective
\ird{-ěc} (glossed \Cv{}.\Ipf{}) and the perfective
\ird{-u} (glossed \Cv{}.\Pf{}).

\pex
\begingl
\gla Tereza kravněc nóví palžek. //
\glb Tereza cry-\Cv{}.\Ipf{} room-\Gen{} leave-\Av{}-\Pf{}//
\glft \trsl{Tereza left the room crying.}//
\endgl
\xe

\pex
\begingl
\gla Nóví palzu Tereza neikravnašek.//
\glb room-\Gen{} leave-\Cv{}.\Pf{} Tereza \mk{incho}-cry-\mk{pf}//
\glft `Having left the room, Tereza started to cry.'//
\endgl
\xe

The syntax of converbial constructions and the specific uses of the perfective
and imperfective converb form are discussed in detail in
\S\,\ref{converbs-syntax}.


\subsection{Supine}

The {\scshape supine}\index{supine} is a non-finite verb form formed used to
indicate necessity or purpose. Both usage has a nominal and a non-nominal form
(used similar to an adverb or an adjective), giving the supine a total of four
forms, as shown below:

\begin{table}
	\sffamily\footnotesize
	\caption{Endings used for the supine.}
	\medskip
	\begin{tblr}{width=0.6\textwidth,colspec={XXX}}
		\toprule 
		&{\sc purpose}&{\sc necessity}\\ 
		\midrule 
		Nominal & {-it} & {-áš}\\ 
		Non-nominal & {-ite} & {-ášce}\\ 
		\bottomrule
	\end{tblr}
\end{table}

These four forms are invariable. The endings attach to the verb after the root
has been conjugated for voice. The use of the non-nominal forms, in addition,
does not require the use of the linking particle \ird{ko}.

\pex
\begingl
\gla >>Ána Karenina<< za gnaža oštinášce tóm.//
\glb Anna Karenina for school-\Acc{} read-\Pv{}-\SupN{} book//
\glft `I have to read \textit{Anna Karenina} for school.'//
\endgl
\xe

Although the usage of the supine has evolved to include various other
constructions not related to its origins as a verbal noun indicating motion, the
supine is still used in Modern Iridian in this original sense, accompanying a
main verb (often a verb of motion) to indicate purpose. Both the nominal and the
non-nominal form can be used in this construction, with the nominal form
(despite being a more recent syntactic innovation) being more common and the
non-nominal form considered more archaic, but still more prevalent in literary
and formal usage. This usage roughly corresponds to the English infinitive, as
in the sentence \trsl{I came here \emph{to bury} Cæsar.} When using the nominal
form the clause containing the main verb is first transformed into a
\ird{to-}clause and then equated to the nominal supine; when using the
non-nominal form, on the other hand, the supine is simply added before the main
verb.

Especially when using the non-nominal construction, the grammatical voice used
for the supine does not need to be the same as the one used in the main verb, as
we see in example (\getfullref{supine.lit}). The supine can only take one
argument, an object, which is always marked in the genitive regardless of its
grammatical voice used to mark the supine governing it.

In addition to this original usage, and to their use in indicating purpose or
necessity, the supine\index{supine} is quite heavily employed idiomatically in
Iridian. In colloquial speech, the supine of purpose is often used to express
future or probable events as a substitute to the contemplative aspect. In both
colloquial and literary registers, it may also be used to indicate a habitual
action or a general truth (instead of the continuous or progressive aspect) when
the verb implies some sort of purpose or consequentiality, especially in
relation to another verb.

\begingl
\gla Dá to tómí oščit.//

\glft \trsl{All grown-ups were children once but only a few remember it.}//
\endgl
\xe

Another common construction involves the supine of necessity with the words
\irdp{shlac}{now} \irdp{mál}{time} (or less frequently \irdp{ór}{hour}). This
construction is somehow similar to English\index{English} \trsl{It's time we
left} or \trsl{It's time for us to go.} When used this way, the supine is
conjugated in the locative voice.\index{supine}

\section{Stative verbs}\label{sec:statives}
\index{verbal adjective|see{stative verb}}\index{stative verb}\index{adjectives}

Iridian lacks a distinct class of adjectives.\footnote{There is however a small
class of attributives, which includes deictics\index{deictics} and
quantifiers\index{quantifiers} among others, which can function as modifiers.
They are different in that these words cannot be used as the
predicate\index{predicate} of a sentence. They are discussed in detail on
Chapter \ref{chap:minor}.} Instead, a special class of verbs called {\scshape
stative verbs} are used to modify noun or noun-like classes. Unlike most verbs,
however, stative verbs can only be marked for aspect and voice. In addition to
this base form (called the {\scshape copulative}), stative verbs also have an
{\scshape attributive} form (used when the verb is preceding the noun or noun
phrase) and {\scshape nominative} form (representing a concrete nominalization
of the verb), both of which are absent in non-attributives verbs. Consider for
example the verb \ird{všihná} \trsl{to be angry}:

\begin{table}
	\sffamily\footnotesize
	\caption{Conjugation pattern for stative verbs}

\end{table}

\subsection{Copulative and attributive forms}\label{sec:stative-copulative}

The copulative form of stative verbs is used when the verb is the predicate of
the sentence. The conjugated form behaves much like a regular verb but only
accepts voice and aspect marking. Unlike regular verbs, stative verbs do not
need to be marked explicitly for voice to be well-formed. However, they still
allow the voice to be marked in the verb but such an operation changes the
meaning of the verb. The examples below illustrate the changes in the copulative
form when marking for voice

\pex
\a\begingl
\gla Mamka všihneví \emph{(not} *všihnaševí\emph{)}//
\glb mother-\Dim{} be:angry-\Cont{} not be:angry-\Av{}-\Cont{}//
\glft \trsl{My mother is angry.}//
\endgl
\a \begingl
\gla Anunce mašy všhinašek.//
\glb announcement crowd-\Acc{} be:angry-\Av{}-\Pf{}//
\glft \trsl{The announcement angered the crowd.}//
\endgl
\a \begingl
\gla Anunce kvuštnik še maše všihnenik.//
\glb announcement hear-\Pv{}-\Pf{} \Com{} crowd be:angry-\Pv{}-\Pf{}//
\glft \trsl{The crowd was angered when they heard the announcement.}//
\endgl
\xe

The attributive form is derived by replacing the infinitive marker \ird{-á} with
\ird{-é}. Other than its conjugated comparative form ending in \ird{-ení}, the
attributive form is invariable. The comparative form\index{comparative
construction}\index{comparison} is often used, especially in colloquial speech,
as an intensifier, even if the stative verb is not actually used in a
comparison.

\ex
\begingl
\gla Všihnení mamka télévoniržek.//
\glb be:angry-\mk{comp-att} mother-\Dim{} call-\Av{}-\Pf{}//
\glft \trsl{Mother was fuming (\emph{lit.,} angrier) when she called us.}//
\endgl
\xe

\ex
\begingl
\gla Všihné Jancí mamka télévoniržek.//
\glb be:angry-\Att{} Janek-\Gen{} mother-\Dim{} call-\Av{}-\Pf{}//
\glft \trsl{Janek's angry mother called}//
\endgl
\xe

Because of the invariability of the attributive form, the copulative form may
sometimes be used as a modifier, similar to a normal verb, separated from the
noun it modifies with the particle \ird{ko}. Note, however, that when conjugated
in the continuous aspect (except when marked explicitly for voice), such usage
is not grammatical, with Iridian only allowing the attributive.

\ex
\begingl
\gla Všihnenik ko tieho snou uprožilšách.//
\glb be:angry-\Pv{}-\Pf{} \Att{} god soon \Refl{}-avenge-\Av{}-\Ctp{} //
\glft \trsl{God whom you have angered will seek vengeance soon.}//
\endgl
\xe

When using a stative verb as a modifier with a noun qualified by a genitive, the
order is usually determined by the specificity of the noun. For example, one
would write \irdp{zuštalé Jancí mamka}{Janek's happy mother} rather than
\ird{Jancí zuštalé mamka} as \ird{Jancí} is considered more specific than
\ird{zuštalé}; i.e., in this context \ird{zuštalé} would be taken to modify
\ird{Jancí mamka} rather than just \ird{mamka}.

When using multiple stative verbs as modifiers, the order is less restricted,
with the order normally determined by whatever the speakers wants to emphasize.
For example, one could write both \ird{hlucé mordé tóm} and \ird{mordé hlucé
tóm} to mean \trsl{a thick, blue book}. It is also common, when using two
stative verbs as modifiers, to use \irdp{a}{and} to separate the two stative
verbs, as in \ird{hlucé a mordé tóm}.

\subsection{Nominative form}\index{stative verb}
The nominative form is derived by replacing the infinitive marker \ird{-á} with
the nominalizing suffix \ird{-ou}. This is the same nominalizing suffix used to
form nouns from regular verbs, the only difference being that stative verbs
allow the suffix to be attached directly on the verb's root.

The copulative form may also be nominalized with \ird{-ou}.
\index{nominalization} However, as with the attributive form, if the copulative
stative verb is conjugated in the continuous aspect and is unmarked for voice,
the nominal form is used instead of the nominalized copulative form.
