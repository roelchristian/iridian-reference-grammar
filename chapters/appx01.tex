\subsection{Ukrainian Dialects}

The Ukrainian dialects of Iridian (\ird{hokr\'an\v{z}evn\'i mieva}), known locally as \ird{гукр\'анжевн\'и мнива} is spoken in the borderlands of Ukraine and Iridia. It forms a dialect continuum with the southeastern dialects of the country and is the dialect with the most number of speakers outside the country. Within the dialect group itself, variations can be observed from the forms spoken from one town to another, mainly because until very recently the language had no official status in Ukraine\footnote{It was recognized as a minority language in 2003.} and its relative isolation from the mainstream dialects of Iridian made it take a path of its own.

As could be expected from its location, this group of dialects has had significant influence from the Ukrainian language (and to a lesser extent, from Russian) and its vocabulary contains more Slavic-derived words than Standard Iridian. These dialects are also written entirely in the Cyrillic script (based on the Iridian Cyrillic alphabet with some spelling conventions adapted from Ukrainian) although in recent years the use of Latin alphabet is becoming more common (primarily due to the rise of text messaging and the internet).

Phonologically, the Ukrainian dialects are perhaps the most divergent. One of the most notable difference is the replacement of nasal vowels with a sequence of an oral vowel and a nasal consonant homorganic with the following stop, or if the nasal vowel was in coda, with an oral vowel and /m/. This also meant that coda /m/ and /n/ no longer nasalizes the preceding vowel (and diphthongize it in case it is an /a/ or an /e/).

\ex
Loss of nasal vowels in Ukrainian Iridian:\\
\irdp{bi\k{e}c}{cat}\quad$\rightarrow$\quad\ird{б\'инц} [bʲiːnt͡s]\\
\irdp{l\k{a}ca}{flatiron}\quad$\rightarrow$\quad\ird{ланца} [ˈlänt͡sɐ]\\
\irdp{b\v{z}\k{e}}{bee}\quad$\rightarrow$\quad\ird{бжем} [bʑɛm]
\xe

\ex
Non-nasalization of vowels before /m/ and /n/:\\
\irdp{bi\k{e}cem}{my cat}[ˈbʲɛ̃w̃t͡sə̃w̃]\quad$\rightarrow$\quad\ird{б\'инцем} [bʲiːnt͡sɪm]\\
