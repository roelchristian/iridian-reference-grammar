\section{Quantifiers}\index{quantifiers}
Iridian has a wide variety of non-numerical/indefinite quantifiers.  Most are actually nouns that used in adjectival or adverbial constructions.


\begin{itemize}
    \item \ird{o\v{s}\v{c}} \trsl{many} (countable)

\section{Interjections}

An interjection\index{interjection} is a word or an expression used to express a spontaneous reaction or feeling. We will use the term `interjection' to refer both to the part of speech and to the utterance type that has the same pragmatic function as this part of speech (cf. \cite{ameka1992}).

Interjections can be classifed into two main categories: \emph{primary} interjections, which refer to a word or an utterance that can only be used as an interjection and \emph{secondary} interjections, which refer to forms belonging a different word class but which through its usage, has acquired a new meaning as an interjection.

Although interjections can function as exclamations, not all exclamatory utterances can be considered as interjectons by themselves. As \textcite{jovanovic2004} notes, any word in a language can theoretically become an exclamation. Consider for example this conversation:

\ex (adapted from \cite{jovanovic2004}).\\

  \ird{
  \noindent--- Martin mlaza boule\v{s}ik.\\
  --- \textbf{Martin\'am?}
  }\medskip

  \trsl{I heard Martin killed his brother.}\\
  \trsl{Martin?!}
\xe


\section{Discourse Particles}

\subsection{Yes and No}
Iridian has several words for yes and no but their usage in responding to yes-no questions does not exactly align with that of English. This is discussed in detail in \S\ref{sec:ansyn}.

There are two main words for \trsl{yes} in Iridian: the affirmative \ird{d\'e} (\trsl{Did you see it?} \trsl{Yes, I did.}) and the contrastive \ird{\v{c}e} (\trsl{Did you not see it?} \trsl{Yes, I did.}. The distinction is similar as that between the French \emph{oui} and \emph{si}. Both \ird{d\'e} and \ird{\v{c}e} generally appear at the end of a sentence. In colloquial spoken Iridian it is also common to see the form \ird{ja} (most likely from the Czech, and ultimately from the German \emph{ja}) and the more informal \ird{j\'o}. These forms however are not cliticized to the verb and appear at the start of a sentence, set off from the rest with a commma. Both \ird{ja} and \ird{j\'o} cannot be used contrastively like \ird{\v{c}e}. It is also common to use both \ird{ja/j\'o} at the same time as \ird{d\'e}.

\pex
\begingl
\gla ---To vdinice? ---Ja vdinek d\'e.//
\glb this see-\mk{pv-pf-quot} yes see-\mk{pv-pf} yes//
\glft \trsl{{}``Did you see it?'' ``Yes, I did.''{}}//
\endgl
\xe

When used by themselves, both \ird{ja} and \ird{j\'o} are often repeated twice or thrice (e.g., \ird{Ja ja ja.})\footnote{Commas are not used to separate each \ird{ja} or \ird{j\'o} in standard orthography. } even when the usage is not emphatic. \ird{D\'e} and \ird{\v{c}e} cannot be used this way.

\section{Numerals}
\par Iridian has a vigesimal number system. Table \ref{one20} shows Iridian numerals from 1 to 20. Numbers from 1 to 10 are given their own name while numbers from 11 to 19 are formed by appending the numbers from one to nine to the clitic \ird{-niem} with the preposition \ird{\v{s}e} (with). The clitic \ird{-niem} is derived from the word for number 10, \ird{nau}, which itself comes from the Old Iridian \rec{nagu}, `half.'
\begin{table}[h!]
	\centering
		\caption{Iridian numerals from 1 to 20.}
\begin{tabu}to 0.8 \textwidth {M[0.5]YM[0.5]Y}
	\toprule
	{\sc number} & {\sc iridian} & {\sc number} & {\sc iridian}\\
	\midrule
	1 & ona			& 11 & on\v{s}eniem\\
	2 & m\"y			& 12 & mui\v{s}eniem\\
	3 & hroná		& 13 & hrona\v{s}eniem\\
	4 & dró			& 14 & dró\v{s}eniem\\
	5 & jed			& 15 & jeceniem\\
	6 &	vú			& 16 & vú\v{s}eniem\\
	7 & \v{s}\v{c}\k{e}	& 17 & \v{s}\v{c}\k{e}ceniem\\
	8 & pie\v{s}		& 18 & pi\k{e}ceniem\\
	9 & cam			& 19 & camzeniem\\
	10& d\'ech			& 20 & tydná\\

	\bottomrule
	\label{one20}
\end{tabu}
\end{table}

For numbers 11 to 19, the words are formed by appending the numbers from one to nine to the suffix \textit{-niem} with the preposition \textit{\v{s}e} (with).

\par Numbers from 21 to 99 are first expressed as multiples of 20. Thenceforth, the number system has largely become decimal, due primarily to the inflyence of surrounding Indo-European languages. Old Iridian, however, had a vigesimal system up to the number 8000.

\par Table \ref{3099} shows multiples of 10 from 30 to 100. The numbers are formed by the numeral followed by \ird{tydná}. For bases that are not multiples of 20, the word \ird{nau} \trsl{ten} is added first, followed by the conjunction \ird{\v{s}e} \trsl{with}.

\begin{table}[h!]
	\centering
	\caption{Iridian numerals from 30 to 100.}
	\begin{tabu}to 0.9 \textwidth {M[0.5]YM[0.5]Y}
		\toprule
		\multicolumn{1}{c}{\sc number} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{\sc iridian} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{\sc number} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{\sc iridian}\\
		\midrule
		30 &	nau\v{s}etydná		& 70 	& nau\v{s}ehronutydná\\
		40 &	muitydná		& 80	& drohutydná\\
		50 &	nau\v{s}emuitydná	& 90	& nau\v{s}edrohutydná\\
		60 &	hronutydná		& 100	& miesy\\
		\bottomrule
		\label{3099}
	\end{tabu}
\end{table}

Iridian counting starts from the smallest component of the number to the largest. Each component can be simply appended with the conjunction \ird{\v{s}e}. Only the numerals in Tables \ref{one20} and \ref{3099}, and the first ten numbers after 100, 500, 1000, etc. appear as single words. Below are some illustrations:

\pex
\a \ird{jecemiesy}\\
	\trsl{five with hundred}\\
	105
\a \ird{cam \v{s}e drohutydná}\\
	\trsl{nine with four twenties}\\
	89
